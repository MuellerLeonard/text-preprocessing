capital allocation through our dividend and share repurchase programs . we expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue for the rest of date but we also anticipate the contribution from our recent acquisitions to partially offset the currency impact . critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the the preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap in the requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes . our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management . those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation compensation retirement and benefit plan assumptions goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes . other than accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes as described below there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as described in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended october number management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable . although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates . an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements . revenue recognition . on november number date we adopted accounting standard codification topic number revenue from contracts with customers asc number . we enter into agreements to sell products hardware software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services . we derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services . a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under asc number . revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services the transaction price . for equipment consumables and most software licenses sold by us control transfers to the customer at a point in time . we use present right to payment legal title physical possession of the asset and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer . where acceptance is not a formality the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service . for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed . product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties returns and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded . revenue from services includes extended warranty customer and software support including : software as a service post contract support consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education . instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period . these contracts are recognized on a basis to revenue over the service period as a measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation . there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed . service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed . we have sales from standalone software . these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations . we determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation . software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer . the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a basis over the maintenance period which is the contractual term of the contract as a measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation . unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a basis . our arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments installation or other services software support or services . hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer . service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer . our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation termination or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue . for contracts with multiple performance obligations we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers . we estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation . selling prices are determined at contract inception for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations . certain of our revenue relate to lease arrangements . standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of asc number and are therefore accounted for in accordance with asc number leases . each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement either as an operating lease or a capital lease using the current lease classification guidance . accounting for income taxes . we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate . the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies . we monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis . if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations . significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part . when it is that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets . we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable . we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income . at january number date we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain and state and foreign deferred tax assets . we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions . although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management . in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due . the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense . if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required . if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary . we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations . on december number date the tax act was enacted into law . the tax act significantly changes the existing tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business . there were no substantial changes from our date annual report on form to the transition tax expenses amount . the company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements . any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined . we have completed our analysis and elected to treat gilti as current period cost . see note number income taxes for more details . adoption of new pronouncements see note number new accounting pronouncements to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements . foreign currency our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities . the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately number percentage points in the three months ended january number when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses . we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods . we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis . we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the condensed consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities . our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively basis up to a rolling period . therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term . to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the dollar cost of the transaction . results from operations net revenue net revenue of number million year . foreign currency movements for the three months ended january number date had a unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately number percentage points when compared to the same period last year . services and other

repurchase program designed among other things to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company employee equity incentive programs . the date repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to number billion of our common stock at the company discretion and has no fixed termination date . the date repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended amended or discontinued at any time . during the three months ended january number date we repurchased and retired approximately number million shares

months ended january number debt there have been no other changes to the principal maturity interest rates and interest payment terms of the agilent outstanding senior notes in the three months ended january number date as compared to the senior notes as described in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended october number other as of january number date our contractual obligations reported under other purchase commitments were approximately number million an increase of approximately number million from fiscal year date primarily due to the new contracts that were during the

leases . we have no other material guarantees or commitments . other liabilities as of january number date and october number date include number million and number million respectively related to income tax liabilities . of these amounts number million and number million related to uncertain tax positions of continuing operations as of january number date and october number date respectively . we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released . however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement .,item . risk factors risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated . visibility into our markets is limited . our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers . in addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets . however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations particularly for capital items may change . any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services . also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us . such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability . also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify . since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins . if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer . we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards . without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer . the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to : properly identify customer needs and predict future needs ; innovate and develop new technologies services and applications ; appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects ; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner ; manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time ; differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings ; price our products competitively ; anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations ; and control product quality in our manufacturing process . in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability . even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our operating results may suffer . in addition promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers . furthermore as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or providing drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures . general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition . our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states . slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in : reduced demand for our products delays in the shipment of orders or increases in order cancellations ; increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories ; increased price pressure for our products and services ; and greater risk of impairment to the value and a detriment to the liquidity of our investment portfolio . failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income . our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate . the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products . during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results . in the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products . in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work . should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product . in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors . in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands . if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses . demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies . our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions . many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidations institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities . fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services . research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies . the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services . if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer . economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations . because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally . we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue . international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes . the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately number percentage points in the three months ended january number when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses . in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states . accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including : interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers ; changes in a specific country or region political economic or other conditions ; changes in diplomatic and trade relationships such as the united kingdom exit from the european union including new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements new or different customs duties trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers ; tariffs imposed by the on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on goods including the tariffs enacted and proposed by the government on various imports from china and by the chinese government on certain goods the scope and duration of which if implemented remains uncertain ; negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations including those related to tax and ; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations ; differing labor regulations ; differing protection of intellectual property ; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements ; and geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil including terrorism and war . we sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from various countries . tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition . further additional tariffs which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition . most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivables and tax functions are centralized at locations in india and malaysia . if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables . our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results . in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies . our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses . for expenses beyond that period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure . in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties . the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts . our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions . we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future . these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases . in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions . any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition . our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel . our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel . if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business . the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures . we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate . however there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees . our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected . in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year . in addition we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio . as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term . we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines . acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner . transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses . in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets or in the case of strategic investments and alliances consolidate results including losses of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment . integrating the operations of acquired businesses within agilent could be a difficult costly and process that involves a number of risks . acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture management team business business infrastructure and sales and distribution and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel . depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and key customers increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources . further the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage . any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations . even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected . as a result the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transaction . a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business . in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products . in exiting a business we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations . all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations . if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted . if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price . effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud . we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of date and continue to enhance our controls . however we can not be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses . inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital . our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations . compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties . our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration controls trade restrictions and . in addition as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive patient health data in the course of our business . the eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may date applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to eu customers and workers . the gdpr established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for including possible fines of up to number percent of total company revenue . other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection . each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages . we must also comply with complex foreign and laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials regulations and sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations . violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results . although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies . these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time . we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations . any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations . in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products . we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations . any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products . if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our operating results and business would suffer . our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda . we also must comply with work safety rules . if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed . we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations . a number of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies . in addition a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies . these regulations govern a wide variety of activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution . if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers ; investigations or notices of fines injunctions and civil penalties ; import or export restrictions ; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions ; increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents ; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers ; or the inability to sell our products . any such fda or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations . some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business . some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the environmental protection agency epa under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws . the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals . the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances . we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change . if we fail to comply with the notification and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be subject to civil penalties criminal prosecution and in some cases prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance . our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations . we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies . such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance . failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting . if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer . our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners . we can not provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy . in particular the foreign corrupt practices act the bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree . any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees . in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire . we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements . our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows . we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations . the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations . significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows . the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business . the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation . consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations . we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and can not predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us . if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted . although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements . additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate . if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results . our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products . because we can not immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements . if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results . if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we can not increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations . this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results . dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics and package delivery services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation . dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively . as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing . if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer . for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis . the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control . if one or more of the package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed . additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays . in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions . since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively . in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price . environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities . certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination . although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled . in other cases we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as hp enterprise formerly company and varian medical systems further other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities for certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation . while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist . in addition in connection with the acquisition of certain companies we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters . any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations . our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve or have involved the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign federal state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations . as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial . although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the united states we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability . failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanction including fines penalties or suspensions . if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected . third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services . from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights . we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis . any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations . a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services . our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement . in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we can not ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all . third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights . our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions . we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights . if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results . our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks . in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage . we may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties . our competitive position may be harmed if we can not detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all . in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons . in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing competing technologies . intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues . furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property . changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax examinations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity . we are subject to taxes in the singapore and various foreign jurisdictions . governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically . any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the or singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results . the date united states tax and jobs act tax act significantly changed the taxation of based multinational corporations . our compliance with the tax act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions . the implementation of the tax act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the internal revenue service as well as state tax authorities . the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation . as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position . we are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world . we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes . these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation . intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions . there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition . a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition . if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly . we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment . several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future . the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income . our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration . if we can not or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized . as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives . we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations . we currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of number billion in senior unsecured notes . we also are party to a unsecured revolving credit facility which in june number date we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by number million and on july number date the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional number million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total number billion . as of january number date we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility . we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock . our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things : increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions ; requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes including capital expenditures acquisitions stock repurchases and dividends ; and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry . our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios . our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control . in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions . if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable . if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed . our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or disasters . in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations . our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with seismic activity . if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility . if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected . in addition because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location . although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism . also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention . economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance . if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss . if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected . we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions . our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events . our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time . if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business . in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage . adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity . as of january number date we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately number billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts . disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid . any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our operating results and financial condition . regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products . we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange sec which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured . the rule which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may of each year requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country . our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin tantalum gold and tungsten . the number of suppliers who provide minerals may be limited . in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities . as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation . we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so . we could incur significant liabilities if the distribution of keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction . we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections number a and number a number d of the internal revenue code . the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters . if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities . notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we received the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion . if the separation is determined to be taxable for federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to federal income tax and we could incur significant federal income tax liabilities . we can not assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock . since the first quarter of fiscal year date we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock . the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant . a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock .,76.5490493774414,75.59867858886719,77.38424682617188,74.5988998413086,True,16:08:06,True,A,2019-03-05

consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the the preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap in the requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes . our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management . those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation compensation retirement and benefit plan assumptions goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes . other than accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes as described below there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as described in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended october number management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable . although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates . an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements . revenue recognition . on november number date we adopted accounting standard codification topic number revenue from contracts with customers asc number . we enter into agreements to sell products hardware software services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services . we derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services . a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under asc number . revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services the transaction price . for equipment consumables and most software licenses sold by us control transfers to the customer at a point in time . we use present right to payment legal title physical possession of the asset and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer . where acceptance is not a formality the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service . for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed . product revenue including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties returns and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded . revenue from services includes extended warranty customer and software support including : software as a service post contract support consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education . instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period . these contracts are recognized on a basis to revenue over the service period as a measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation . there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed . service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed . we have sales from standalone software . these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations . we determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation . software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer . the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a basis over the maintenance period which is the contractual term of the contract as a measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation . unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a basis . our arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments installation or other services software support or services . hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer . service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer . our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation termination or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue . for contracts with multiple performance obligations we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers . we estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation . selling prices are determined at contract inception for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations . certain of our revenue relate to lease arrangements . standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of asc number and are therefore accounted for in accordance with asc number leases . each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement either as an operating lease or a capital lease using the current lease classification guidance . accounting for income taxes . we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate . the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies . we monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis . if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations . significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part . when it is that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets . we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable . we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income . at april number date we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain and state and foreign deferred tax assets . we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions . although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management . in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due . the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense . if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required . if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary . we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations . on december number date the tax act was enacted into law . the tax act significantly changes the existing tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business . there were no substantial changes from our date annual report on form to the transition tax expenses amount . the company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements . any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined . we have completed our analysis and elected to treat global intangible income gilti as current period cost . see note number income taxes for more details . adoption of new pronouncements see note number new accounting pronouncements to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements . foreign currency our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities . the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately number percentage points in the six months ended april number when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses . we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods . we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis . we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the condensed consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities . our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively basis up to a rolling period . therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term . to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the dollar cost of the transaction . results from operations net revenue net revenue of number million for the three months ended april year . net revenue of number million for the six months ended april year . foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately number percentage points in both periods when compared to the same periods last year . services and other revenue increased number percent and number percent services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from agilent crosslab services and services in the diagnostics and genomics business . some of the prominent services in the agilent crosslab business include repair and maintenance on instruments compliance services and installation services . some of the prominent services in the diagnostics and genomics business include consulting services related to the companion diagnostics and nucleic acid businesses . the service revenue from the agilent crosslab business increased number percent in both periods with a number percentage point unfavorable currency impact in both periods when compared to the same periods last year . the growth in the service revenue from the agilent crosslab business for both periods were driven by the improving connect service rate on current instrument base as well as increase in higher value service offerings . the service revenue from the diagnostics and genomics business increased number percent and number percent the increase in diagnostics and genomics service revenue reflects strong growth in both periods throughout the entire portfolio . net revenue by segment revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business decreased number percent and was flat foreign currency movements in both periods when compared to the same periods last year . for the three months ended april number date revenue growth within the academia and government and forensics markets was strong but was more than offset by weaker revenue from the food market and to a lesser extend from the pharmaceutical and chemical and energy markets when compared to the same period last year . for the six months ended april number date revenue growth within the academia and government and forensics markets was strong with modest revenue growth within the pharmaceutical market that was fully offset by weaker revenue from the food market and to a lesser extent from the chemical and energy market when compared to the same period last year . revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased number percent and number percent foreign currency movements and number percentage points revenue growth within the diagnostics and clinical market continued to be strong led by performance from our nucleic acid solutions and biomolecular analysis businesses . revenue generated by agilent crosslab in the three and six months ended april number date increased number percent and number percent foreign currency movements and number percentage points revenue grew across all key end markets with strong growth in the food and academia and government markets . revenue growth was driven broadly by our entire service and supplies portfolio . operating results total gross margin increased number percentage point and was relatively flat gross margin reflects the impact of lower inventory charges lower materials costs and favorable currency impact on costs offset by increased wages higher expenses related to tariffs and higher amortization expense of intangible assets . research and development expenses in the three and six months ended april number date increased number percent in both periods when compared to the same

possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement .,item . risk factors risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated . visibility into our markets is limited . our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers . in addition our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets . however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations particularly for capital items may change . any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services . also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us . such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability . also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify . since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales research and development and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins . if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer . we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards . without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer . the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to : properly identify customer needs and predict future needs ; innovate and develop new technologies services and applications ; appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects ; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner ; manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time ; differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings ; price our products competitively ; anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations ; and control product quality in our manufacturing process . in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability . even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our operating results may suffer . in addition promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers . furthermore as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures . general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition . our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states . slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in : reduced demand for our products delays in the shipment of orders or increases in order cancellations ; increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories ; increased price pressure for our products and services ; and greater risk of impairment to the value and a detriment to the liquidity of our investment portfolio . failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income . our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate . the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products . during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results . in the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products . in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work . should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product . in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors . in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands . if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses . demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers research and development budgets and on government funding policies . our customers include pharmaceutical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions . many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources mergers and consolidations institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities . fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services . research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources consolidation spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies . the timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services . if demand for our products and services is adversely affected our revenue and operating results would suffer . economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations . because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally . we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue . international revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes . the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately number percentage points in the six months ended april number when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses . in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states . accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including : interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers ; changes in a specific country or region political economic or other conditions ; changes in diplomatic and trade relationships such as the united kingdom exit from the european union including new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements new or different customs duties trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers ; tariffs imposed by the on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on goods including the tariffs enacted and proposed by the government on various imports from china and by the chinese government on certain goods negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations including those related to tax and ; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations ; differing labor regulations ; differing protection of intellectual property ; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements ; and geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil including terrorism and war . we sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from various countries . tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition . further additional tariffs the scope and duration of which if implemented remains uncertain which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition . most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting cost accounting accounts payable accounts receivables and tax functions are centralized at locations in india and malaysia . if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables . our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results . in addition although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies . our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate within any given period the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses . for expenses beyond that period our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure . in addition our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties . the weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts . our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions . we have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar activities in the future . these strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases . in addition delays in implementing our strategic initiatives unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions . any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition . our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel . our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel . if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business . the markets in which we operate are very dynamic and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures . we believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate . however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees . our acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected . in the normal course of business we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic investments and alliances joint ventures and divestitures and generally expect to complete several transactions per year . in addition we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio . as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term . we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines . acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner . transactions such as acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in unexpected significant costs and expenses . in the future we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets up to the full amount of the value of the assets or in the case of strategic investments and alliances consolidate results including losses of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment . integrating the operations of acquired businesses within agilent could be a difficult costly and process that involves a number of risks . acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture management team business model business infrastructure and sales and distribution and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed decentralized operations and personnel . depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected the retention of key employees and key customers increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources . further the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage . any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations . even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within agilent we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected . as a result the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions . a successful divestiture depends on various factors including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to the purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business . in addition if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products . in exiting a business we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations . all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations . if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted . if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price . effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud . we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of date and continue to enhance our controls . however we can not be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses . inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements the trading price of our stock and our access to capital . our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations . compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties . our customers and we are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety packaging product content employment labor and immigration controls trade restrictions and . in addition as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal sensitive patient health data in the course of our business . the eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may date applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to eu customers and workers . the gdpr established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for including possible fines of up to number percent of total company revenue . other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection . each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages . we must also comply with complex foreign and laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials regulations and sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control and other similar laws and regulations . violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and our operating results . although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies . these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time . we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations . any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations . in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products . we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations . any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products . if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our operating results and business would suffer . our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the fda . we also must comply with work safety rules . if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed . we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation business financial condition and results of operations . a number of our products are subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies . in addition a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the fda and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies . these regulations govern a wide variety of activities from quality management design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution . if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply we may face among other things warning letters ; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers ; investigations or notices of fines injunctions and civil penalties ; import or export restrictions ; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions ; increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents ; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers ; or the inability to sell our products . any such fda or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations . some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business . some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the environmental protection agency epa under the toxic substances control act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws . the toxic substances control act regulations govern among other things the testing manufacture processing and distribution of chemicals the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals . the toxic substances control act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the united states that has not been reviewed by the epa for its effect on health and safety and placed on an epa inventory of chemical substances . we must ensure conformance of the manufacturing processing distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change . if we fail to comply with the notification and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products then we could be subject to civil penalties criminal prosecution and in some cases prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance . our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations . we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies . such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance . failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension from future government contracting . if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer . our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners . we can not provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy . in particular the foreign corrupt practices act the bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree . any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees . in addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire . we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business reputation and financial statements . our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows . we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations . the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations . significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows . the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business . the life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation . consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations . we may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and can not predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us . if we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted . although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world we have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements . additionally we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes which are technically complex and require expertise to operate . if we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted which could adversely affect our business and operating results . our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products . because we can not immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements . if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results . if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments we can not increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations . this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results . dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics and package delivery services may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation . dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively . as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing . if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer . for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis . the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control . if one or more of the package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed . additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays . in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions . since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively . in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price . environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities . certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination . although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled . in other cases we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as hp enterprise formerly company and varian medical systems further other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities for certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation . while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist . in addition in connection with the acquisition of certain companies we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters . any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations . our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve or have involved the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign federal state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations . as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial . although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the united states we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability . further in the event that any future change legislation would require that standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities we may be required to make certain changes and to our manufacturing processes . failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanction including fines penalties or suspensions . if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected . third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services . from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights . we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis . any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations . a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services . our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement . in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we can not ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all . third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights . our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions . we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights . if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results . our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks . in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage . we may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties . our competitive position may be harmed if we can not detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all . in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons . in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing competing technologies . intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues . furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property . changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax examinations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity . we are subject to taxes in the singapore and various foreign jurisdictions . governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically . any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the or singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results . the tax act significantly changed the taxation of based multinational corporations . our compliance with the tax act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions . the implementation of the tax act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the internal revenue service irs as well as state tax authorities . the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation . as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position . we are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world . we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes . these assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation . intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions . there can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition . a difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition . if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly . we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment . several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future . the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income . our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration . if we can not or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized . as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives . we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations . on march number date agilent entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for a number billion unsecured credit facility that will expire on march number the credit facility replaces the existing credit facility which was terminated on the closing date of the new facility . as of april number date the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility . we also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of number billion in senior unsecured notes . we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock . our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things : increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions ; requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes including capital expenditures acquisitions stock repurchases and dividends ; and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry . our credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios . our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control . in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions . if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable . if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe our operations could be seriously harmed . our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism increasing or of events or other natural or disasters . in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations . our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with seismic activity . if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility . if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected . in addition because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location . although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism . also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention . economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance . if our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss . if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected . we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions . our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events . our information technology systems also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time . if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business . in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage . adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity . as of april number date we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately number billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts . disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid . any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our operating results and financial condition . regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products . we are subject to the rules of the sec which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured . the rule which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the sec by may of each year requires companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country . our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tin tantalum gold and tungsten . the number of suppliers who provide minerals may be limited . in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities . as our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation . we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so . we could incur significant liabilities if the distribution of keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction . we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections number a and number a number d of the internal revenue code . the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters . if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities . notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we received the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion . if the separation is determined to be taxable for federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to federal income tax and we could incur significant federal income tax liabilities . we can not assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock . since the first quarter of fiscal year date we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock . the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant . a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock .,64.34455108642578,64.49847412109375,67.61515808105469,69.07512664794922,True,16:08:36,True,A,2019-05-30
