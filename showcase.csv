Overview
BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $5.98 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2018. With approximately 14,900 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.
Our diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), separate accounts, collective investment trusts and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin®, Aladdin Wealth, Cachematrix and FutureAdvisor, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients. The Company is highly regulated and manages its clients’ assets as a fiduciary. We do not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients.
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors.
BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management and technology service relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through third-party distribution relationships, including financial professionals and pension consultants.
BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over two-thirds of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors. At December 31, 2018, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) held 21.6% of BlackRock’s voting common stock and 22.0% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which includes outstanding common and nonvoting preferred stock.
Management seeks to deliver value for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on BlackRock’s differentiated competitive position, including:
•
the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for index products;
•
the Company’s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 50% of employees outside the United States serving clients locally and supporting local investment capabilities. Approximately 40% of total AUM is managed for clients domiciled outside the United States;
•
the Company’s breadth of investment strategies, including market-cap weighted index, factors, systematic active, traditional fundamental active, high conviction alpha and illiquid alternative product offerings, which enhance its ability to tailor single- and multi-asset investment solutions to address specific client needs;
•
the Company’s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and macro trends including the secular shift to index investing and ETFs, a focus on income and retirement, and barbelling using index, active and illiquid alternatives products; and
•
the Company’s longstanding commitment to innovation, technology services and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock technology products and solutions, including Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, Cachematrix, and FutureAdvisor. This commitment is further extended by minority investments in distribution technologies including Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Envestnet.
BlackRock operates in a global marketplace impacted by changing market dynamics and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.
The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in Aladdin and other technology products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures.
See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures”, for further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2018, 2017, and 2016.
In 2014, general and administration expense relating to the reduction of an indemnification asset has been excluded since it is directly offset by a tax benefit of the same amount and, consequently, did not impact BlackRock’s book value. In 2015 and 2014, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense).
(3)
Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items referred to above and also include the effect on deferred income tax expense resulting from certain income tax matters.
(4)
Results for 2017 and 2016 were recast to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Results for 2015 and 2014 reflect accounting guidance prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

Percentage represents CAGR over a five-year period (2013-2018).
AUM represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.
Investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users or accomplishment of specific deliverables.
At December 31, 2018, total AUM was $5.98 trillion, representing a CAGR of 7% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including BKCA, Infraestructura Institucional and FutureAdvisor, which collectively added $2.2 billion of AUM in 2015, BofA Global Capital Management which added $80.6 billion of AUM in 2016, First Reserve which added $3.3 billion of AUM in 2017 and the net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction which added $27.5 billion of AUM in 2018. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.
The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:

Client Type
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, with a regionally focused business model. BlackRock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment, risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent.
Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors.
iShares ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as iShares ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, iShares ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in iShares ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections.

•
US retail long-term net inflows of $24.3 billion were led by fixed income inflows of $14.9 billion. Fixed income net inflows were diversified across exposures and products, with strong flows into our municipal, unconstrained and short duration bond offerings. Equity net inflows of $7.0 billion were driven by flows into our index mutual funds.
•
International retail long-term net outflows of $5.2 billion resulted from net outflows in equity and fixed income, partially offset by multi-asset and alternatives net inflows. Multi-asset net inflows of $1.6 billion were led by flows into the Multi-Asset Income fund family, while alternatives net inflows of $1.5 billion reflected flows into global and European hedge funds. Equity net outflows of $4.9 billion were primarily due to outflows from European equities, as political and market uncertainty contributed to a risk-off environment in the region. Fixed income net outflows of $3.4 billion reflected net outflows from unconstrained and high yield bond funds.
iShares ETFs
iShares is the leading ETF provider in the world, with $1.7 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2018 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 20181 with net inflows of $167.5 billion driving an organic growth rate of 10%. The iShares Core had net inflows of $106.2 billion, while iShares ETFs outside the Core had net inflows of $61.3 billion. iShares equity net inflows of $112.8 billion were driven by flows into Core funds, products with broad developed market equity exposures and factor-based ETFs. Fixed income net inflows of $50.9 billion were diversified across exposures and product lines, led by flows into Core, treasuries and emerging market debt funds. iShares ETF multi-asset and alternative funds contributed a combined $3.8 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities funds. iShares ETFs represented 31% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2018 and 41% of long-term base fees for 2018.

Amounts included net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction.
Institutional active AUM ended 2018 at $1.1 trillion, reflecting $9.6 billion of net outflows. Fixed income net outflows of $20.7 billion reflected several large client redemptions associated with client M&A, cash repatriation and manager consolidation. Equity net outflows of $7.9 billion were from fundamental and quantitative strategies.
Multi-asset products saw continued growth, with net inflows of $11.9 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the LifePath® target-date suite. Alternatives net inflows of $7.1 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure, private equity solutions and real estate. Excluding return of capital and investment of $2.3 billion, alternatives net inflows were $9.4 billion. In addition, 2018 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, and we raised approximately $13 billion in new commitments, which will be a source of future net inflows. In total, Institutional active represented 19% of long-term AUM and 20% of long-term base fees.
Institutional index AUM totaled $2.1 trillion at December 31, 2018, reflecting net outflows of $53.7 billion. Equity net outflows of $91.8 billion resulted from client de-risking, re-allocating, re-balancing and seeking liquidity in a more volatile market environment. Fixed income net inflows of $37.3 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions. Institutional index represented 38% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2018 and accounted for 9% of long-term base fees for 2018.
BlackRock’s institutional franchise generated 2% organic base fee growth in 2018 despite $63.3 billion of net outflows, reflecting strength in higher-fee illiquid alternatives, multi-asset solutions and liability-driven investment strategies.
The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:
•
Pensions, Foundations and Endowments. BlackRock is among the world’s largest managers of pension plan assets with $2.2 trillion, or 68%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2018. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $20.3 billion of long-term net inflows for the year, driven by continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite. Defined contribution represented $835.5 billion of total pension AUM, and we remain well
positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $80.1 billion, or 3%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.
•
Official Institutions. BlackRock managed $166.6 billion, or 5%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2018. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.
•
Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $240.6 billion, or 8%, of institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2018. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $514.4 billion, or 16%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Amounts included net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction.
Long-term product offerings include alpha-seeking active and index strategies. Our alpha-seeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile, and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and iShares ETFs.
Although many clients use both alpha-seeking active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class, or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.
Equity
Year-end 2018 equity AUM totaled $3.036 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $15.2 billion. Net inflows included $112.8 billion into iShares ETFs, driven by net inflows into Core funds, broad developed market equities and factor-based ETFs, partially offset by non-ETF index and active net outflows of $85.2 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively.
BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate.
Fixed Income
Fixed income AUM ended 2018 at $1.884 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $79.1 billion. iShares ETFs net inflows of $50.9 billion were led by flows into Core, treasuries and emerging markets debt funds. Non-ETF index net inflows of $40.2 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions. Active net outflows of $12.0 billion were primarily due to several large institutional client redemptions associated with client M&A, cash repatriation and manager consolidation.
Multi-Asset
BlackRock’s multi-asset team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.

Multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $12.9 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows, and contributed $17.7 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2018, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings. Retail net inflows of $2.9 billion reflected demand for our Multi-Asset Income fund family, which raised $2.2 billion in 2018.
The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:
•
Asset allocation and balanced products represented 38% of multi-asset AUM at year-end. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products in this category include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families.
•
Target date and target risk products grew 10% organically in 2018, with net inflows of $20.2 billion. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 84% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation overlay model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products.
•
Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer (“OCIO”). These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.
•
FutureAdvisor is a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients’ investments. As consumers increasingly engage with technology to invest, BlackRock and FutureAdvisor are positioned to empower distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining FutureAdvisor’s technology-enabled advice with BlackRock’s multi-asset investment capabilities, proprietary technology and risk analytics. FutureAdvisor AUM does not include underlying iShares ETF investments.
Alternatives
BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into two main categories - 1) core alternatives, and 2) currency and commodities. Core includes liquid alternatives offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds), as well as illiquid offerings in alternative solutions, private equity solutions (funds of funds), opportunistic and credit, real estate and infrastructure. BlackRock alternatives products are described below.
In 2018, alternatives generated $12.1 billion of net inflows, or $15.1 billion excluding return of capital/investment of $3.0 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital/investment were private equity solutions, credit and real estate. Net inflows were driven by infrastructure, alternative solutions and hedge fund solutions. In addition, we raised approximately $13 billion of new commitments in 2018 across a variety of strategies, led by infrastructure and private equity solutions. At year-end, we had approximately $24 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying.
We believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. Our highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.

Core
The Company’s core alternatives strategies include the following:
•
Liquid Alternatives net inflows of $2.0 billion were due to net inflows of $2.1 billion from direct hedge funds, partially offset by $0.1 billion of net outflows from hedge fund solutions. Direct hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings.
•
Alternative Solutions represents highly customized portfolios of alternative investments. In 2018, alternative solutions portfolios had $0.3 billion of net inflows.
•
Private Equity and Opportunistic AUM included $13.3 billion in private equity solutions and $8.7 billion in opportunistic and credit offerings. Net inflows of $3.4 billion included $1.7 billion of net inflows into both private equity solutions and opportunistic and credit strategies.
•
Real Assets AUM, which includes infrastructure and real estate, totaled $34.3 billion, reflecting net inflows of $3.9 billion, led by infrastructure deployments.
Currency and Commodities
The Company’s currency and commodities products include a range of active and index products.
Currency and commodities products had $2.5 billion of net inflows, primarily driven by iShares ETFs. Our iShares ETFs commodities products represented $25.1 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.
Cash Management
Cash management AUM totaled $448.6 billion at December 31, 2018. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs, New Taiwan Dollars or British pounds. While full year 2018 net flows were impacted by two large planned redemptions totaling $40.0 billion, base fees grew 9%. Strong growth in cash management also reflects successful integration of acquisitions to strengthen our platform and leverage our scale, including the 2017 acquisition of Cachematrix, a distribution technology portal enabling corporate treasurers to allocate among cash management products, and the 2016 transaction with BofA Global Capital Management.
Client Region
Our footprints in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions reflect strong relationships with intermediaries and an established ability to deliver our global investment expertise in funds and other products tailored to local regulations and requirements.

Americas
Net inflows of $149.8 billion were driven by net inflows into equity, fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives of $64.3 billion, $62.8 billion, $23.2 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. During the year, we served clients through offices in 32 states in the United States as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Spain.
EMEA
EMEA net outflows of $19.1 billion were primarily due to low-fee institutional index equity outflows, partially offset by strong flows into iShares ETFs.

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, which serves as the investment and risk management system for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via the Aladdin Risk offering; as well as investment accounting capabilities. Provider Aladdin is a tool used by BlackRock’s custodial partners, connecting them to the platform to add operational efficiency. BlackRock also offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities, FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients’ investments, and Cachematrix, a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform.
Technology services revenue of $785 million was up 19% year-over-year. Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue.
At year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in the digital distribution companies Scalable Capital and iCapital, Acorns, a micro-investing tool, and Envestnet, a leading independent provider of technology-enabled, web-based investment solutions and services to financial advisors. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and for other minority investments records changes in their respective values within nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.
Securities Lending
Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.
Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $267 billion, up from $262 billion at year-end 2017. On average, relative to 2017, asset and liability spreads were slightly lower. However, continued asset gathering in lending products resulted in increased balances compared to 2017.
BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.
Risk & Quantitative Analysis
Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.
COMPETITION
BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.
Geographic Information
At December 31, 2018, BlackRock served clients in more than 100 countries across the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. See Note 25, Segment Information, contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, BlackRock had a total of approximately 14,900 employees, including approximately 7,500 located in offices outside the United States.
REGULATION
Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock.
The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.
GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM
BlackRock’s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) was signed into law in the United States (“US”). Dodd-Frank is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions, many of which have been adopted. BlackRock has implemented a conformance program to address certain regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank, as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) investment company modernization initiatives. The cost of these conformance activities has been substantially absorbed by BlackRock; however, as certain limited aspects of Dodd-Frank and other rules are still being adopted, it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that any implementation of these rules and regulations will have upon BlackRock’s business, financial condition, and operating activities.
Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) Review
The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), is considering potential systemic risk related to asset management; statements made by these organizations have generally indicated that they are, at this time, focused on products and activities, rather than designation, in their approach to the review of asset managers. The FSB has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of nonbank non-insurers in the future to address “residual risks”. Any measures applied in relation to a global systemically important financial institution (“G-SIFI”) designation from the FSB would need to be implemented through existing regulatory processes and procedures by relevant national authorities.
In the US, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs. The FSOC’s most recent statements generally indicate that it is focused on products and activities, rather than entity-specific designation, in its review of asset managers. The US Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) report on asset management, issued in October 2017 pursuant to the Executive Order (as defined below), also expressed this view. In addition, in November 2017, Treasury made recommendations concerning the process by which the FSOC designates nonbanks as SIFIs, further supporting a products and activities approach to addressing risks in asset management. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI under Dodd-Frank, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “Federal Reserve”).
Taxation
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US authorities. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) was enacted. As proposed regulations and new guidance are released, the Company continues to assess the impact of tax reform.
In addition, certain European Union (“EU”) Member States have enacted financial transaction taxes (“FTTs”) which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instruments and derivatives transactions, and the European Commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
The SEC, Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. In December 2015, the SEC proposed a rule governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies that, if enacted, would represent a fundamental change in the nature of the SEC's regulations governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by registered investment companies. This proposal has the potential to require BlackRock to change or restrict certain investment strategies or practices for some registered investment companies and incur additional costs.
Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements.
In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to Dodd-Frank central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts and will continue to be phased in for other types of BlackRock funds and accounts over time. On March 1, 2017, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, became subject to requirements in the US, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks.
Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds
As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the potential risks in ETFs, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other large issuers of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company’s business.
In addition, in June 2018, the SEC issued a proposed rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) known as the “ETF Rule”. The ETF Rule is intended to establish a clear and consistent framework that allows most ETFs operating under the Investment Company Act to come to market without applying for individual exemptive orders.
Volcker Rule
Provisions of Dodd-Frank referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “Bank Holding Company Act”) that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve has taken the position that PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock, which is approximately 22%, causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule. Conformance with the Volcker Rule may require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in its covered funds, which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions.
Securities and Exchange Commission Standards of Conduct Proposal
In April 2018, the SEC published a package of proposed rules and a proposed interpretation (collectively, the “Proposals”) intended to improve the retail investor experience and provide greater clarity regarding customers’ relationships with broker-dealers and investment advisers. The Proposals would: (i) create a principles-based standard of conduct for broker-dealers and require broker-dealers to act in the “best interest” of retail customers; (ii) “clarify and reaffirm” investment advisers’ fiduciary obligations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”); and (iii) create additional disclosure obligations for broker-dealers and investment advisers to help retail investors better understand relationships with investment professionals. The SEC also proposed the introduction of an enhanced disclosure regime, in addition to certain new compliance obligations for investment advisers that currently apply only to broker-dealers. If adopted without change, the Proposals could increase BlackRock’s disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain educational and other services to its clients.
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers
In 2015, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Proposed Rule”) that would extend to a number of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Advisers Act, the requirement to establish written risk-based anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”). The Proposed Rule would include investment advisers within the Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of “financial institutions”, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements. If adopted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs.
Securities and Exchange Commission Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers
BlackRock’s business may also be impacted by SEC regulatory initiatives. The SEC and its staff are engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. In so doing, it has adopted rules that include (i) new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain US registered funds; (ii) enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers; and (iii) implementing liquidity risk management programs for ETFs and open-end funds, other than money market funds. These rules, many of which are currently in an implementation period, will increase BlackRock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock’s growth.
US Executive Order
On February 3, 2017, an executive order (the “Executive Order”) was issued articulating certain core principles for regulating the US financial system and directing the Secretary of the US Treasury to report on the extent to which existing laws, treaties, rules, regulations and policies promote, support or inhibit the federal regulation of the US financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles. Treasury has issued four reports in response to the Executive Order (the “Treasury Reports”), which include a number of recommendations, the majority of which require further legislative or regulatory action in order to be implemented, that may affect BlackRock’s business or operations. BlackRock will continue to monitor the potential impact of the Executive Order, as well as the Treasury Reports and any consequential legislative or regulatory action, on its business.
Money Market Fund Reform
In June 2017, the European Commission published new Money Market Regulations (the “MM Regulations”) which took effect in January 2019. The MM Regulations are intended to reduce perceived risks of EU-based money market products. The MM Regulations limit the use of constant net asset value money market funds to those holding only government money market instruments and introduce a new category of “low volatility net asset value” money market funds and two types of “variable net asset value funds”. All categories of money market funds are subject to reinforced liquidity requirements, as well as safeguards such as liquidity fees and redemption gates. The MM Regulations require fundamental changes to many of the Company’s money market funds offered in the EU and may reduce their attractiveness to investors.
In the US, there is currently legislation pending in Congress that would repeal the requirement that institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds float their net asset values. It is uncertain whether the legislation will pass Congress and become law.
British Exit from the EU
Following the June 2016 vote to exit the EU, the United Kingdom (“UK”) served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29, 2017 to initiate the two-year long process of exiting from the EU, commonly referred to as ""Brexit"". There is substantial uncertainty surrounding the terms upon which the UK will ultimately exit the EU. As a result, the UK’s relationship with the EU, as well as whether an agreement will be reached by the March 29, 2019 exit deadline, remains unclear. Moreover, the passage of time without a resolution in place has become a source of economic, political and regulatory instability. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. These steps, many of which have been time-consuming and costly, are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, BlackRock may experience organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
MiFID II Regime
BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in Europe. For example, in the EU, rules and regulations made under the previous Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) were revised in January 2018 through implementation of “MiFID II”. The MiFID II package is made up of a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, a Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a number of Implementing and Regulatory Technical Standards in the form of Delegated Acts made by the European Commission following advice from the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”). The MiFID II reforms materially changed market transparency requirements, enhanced protections afforded to investors and increased operational complexity for the Company. In particular, MiFID II introduced (i) enhanced governance and investor protection standards, (ii) prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms’ ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes, (iii) rules on the identification and monitoring of target markets for MiFID financial instruments by MiFID investment firms who manufacture and/or distribute such instruments, (iv) enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading, (v) the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues, (vi) the extension of pre- and post-trade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments, (vii) restrictions on the use of so-called dark pool trading, (viii) the creation of a new type of trading venue called the Organized Trading Facility for non-equity financial instruments, (ix) new commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements, (x) a move away from vertical silos in execution, clearing and settlement, (xi) an enhanced role for ESMA in supervising EU securities and derivatives markets and (xii) new requirements regarding non-EU investment firms’ access to EU financial markets. The industry is continuing to adapt to the implementation of these measures, which is having direct and indirect impacts on BlackRock and its subsidiaries and has required significant changes to client servicing models. As a result, the broad nature of the MiFID II reforms may continue to impact BlackRock’s product development, client servicing and distribution models, and will require additional disclosures in respect of costs and fees
BlackRock charges to certain of its clients. MiFID II also impacts the ability of certain of BlackRock’s distribution partners to accept commissions. Further, as market structure reforms become fully embedded, these may impact the way that the Company executes investment decisions for client portfolios and reports on such transactions and could have an impact on general market liquidity.
EU Market Access
The European Commission and certain EU Member States have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for “equivalence”, which is the process by which the legal, regulatory and/or supervisory system in non-EU Member States is recognized by the European Commission as comparably effective to that in the EU, thereby allowing such non-EU Member States access to the EU single market in financial services. Additionally, in September 2017, the European Commission issued a proposal requiring that all third-country outsourcing, delegation and risk transfer arrangements be assessed by ESMA. If enacted, the proposal would transfer to ESMA the ability of EU Member States to authorize the outsourcing of asset management activities beyond the EU’s borders. While the proposal remains under discussion, if enacted, it could significantly impact asset management firms with non-EU operations, including BlackRock, and it may affect the Company’s ability to delegate fund management, supporting activity and/or costs associated with such delegation.
Cessation of LIBOR/EURIBOR
The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) administrator that publishes the rate, has announced that it will no longer compel panel banks to submit rates for LIBOR after year-end 2021. As a result, LIBOR, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and certain other indices which are utilized as benchmarks may no longer be published. The disappearance, or change in the manner of administration, of these benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for any BlackRock investments in instruments and securities linked to such benchmarks. BlackRock may also face operational challenges adopting successor benchmarks.
Revised EU Capital Requirements
EU regulators are considering how to design an appropriate capital regime for non-systemically important investment firms as the current regime is based upon banking requirements and has not been materially modified for asset managers. In December 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms. The new legislative package is expected to come into effect in 2020 once agreed upon by the European Council and Parliament. Once implemented, any new requirements could result in significant changes to the amount of regulatory capital that BlackRock is required to hold in the EU.
UK Asset Management Market Study
The FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer “value” to investors. Beginning in 2020, BlackRock will be required annually to disclose the conclusions of its assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If “value” has not been provided to consumers, BlackRock will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA’s final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and it will consider various remedies in 2019, including mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA’s remedies could have a significant impact on BlackRock’s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.
Senior Managers and Certification Regime
In the UK, the FCA is extending the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”) to all financial services firms beginning in December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.
Reform of European Retail Distribution Rules
BlackRock must comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors, and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. The rules were originally introduced in the UK in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where BlackRock operates such as the Netherlands and Switzerland, and are under discussion elsewhere. Similarly, MiFID II contains a ban on certain types of advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules are creating inconsistencies among distribution rules in different jurisdictions and may lead to changes to BlackRock’s client servicing and distribution models, in particular affecting the fees BlackRock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners.
EU Shareholder Rights Directive
The European Commission has revised the Shareholder Rights Directive (“SRD”) to enhance engagement between companies and their long-term shareholders. The revisions, which are effective in June 2019, require investment managers to provide EU institutional investors with enhanced disclosures on shareholder engagement and voting, and information on how the manager’s investment strategy contributes to such investors’ medium to long-term performance. It is uncertain whether regulators throughout the EU will be unified in their approach to interpreting compliance with the SRD, and any inconsistencies may complicate BlackRock’s ability to demonstrate compliance.
EXISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (“DoL”), the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies.
Certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through Attorneys General, Insurance Commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities.
The Investment Company Act imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, was required to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) as a result of SEC rules giving effect to a section of Dodd-Frank requiring such registration. The rules subject BTC to new and additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.
BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA.
BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”) with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of Dodd-Frank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Two of BlackRock’s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange and a member of the MSRB, subject to MSRB rules.
US Banking Regulation
One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC’s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders.
As described in “Item 1 - Business”, as of December 31, 2018 PNC owned approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which may subject BlackRock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC. The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve has taken the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule, that are more restrictive than those the Company is subject to under other applicable laws, as well as the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve, which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any effort by BlackRock to contest a control determination by the Federal Reserve may be costly and complex, and may not result in a reversal of such determination.
Regulation of Securities Financing Transactions
In its 2014 Annual Report, FSOC identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions. In addition, in November 2015, the EU introduced a regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions and total return swaps (“SFTR”). The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. The regulation is being implemented in phases and more detailed rules and guidance, including in respect of reporting obligations, is in process. As these rules and guidance become clearer, BlackRock may be required to introduce further compliance measures, which will subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock’s securities financing transaction activities, including potential adjustments to its activities as agent lender for its clients.
Regulation of Money Market Funds
In October 2016, rules were implemented to reform the regulatory structure governing US money market funds to address perceived systemic risks of money market funds. The rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Retail money market funds continue operating with a constant net asset value per share. The rules additionally provide for tools for institutional and retail money market funds’ boards designed to address market shocks, including the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances.
EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.
Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.
Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.
European Regulation
The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It also prudentially regulates those UK subsidiaries’ branches established in other EU countries and is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branches of certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and theme-based reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.
In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established.
BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EU. MiFID, the scope of which was enhanced through MiFID II, sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock European subsidiaries must also comply with the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Mediation Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms (the Capital Requirements Directive and Capital Requirements Regulation). These include requirements on capital, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which imposes obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of alternative investment funds that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations.
BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to an EU regulation on over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties) and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an ESMA-registered or recognized derivatives trade repository.
The EU has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”). The latest initiative in this area, UCITS V, seeks to align the UCITS depositary regime, UCITS remuneration rules and regulators’ power to sanction for breaches of the UCITS Directive with the requirements of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. Compliance with the updated UCITS directive subjects BlackRock to additional expenses associated with new depositary oversight and other organizational requirements.
Most EU Member States and other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches. For example, in May 2018, the EU Data Protection Directive was replaced by a more extensive General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock’s collection, processing and retention of personal data and reporting of data breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.
Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region
In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (“FIEA”) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEA. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act.
In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws, and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services activities in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection.
The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector. Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.

As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.
MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS
Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, could cause:
•
the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;
•
the withdrawal of funds from BlackRock’s products in favor of products offered by competitors;
•
the rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;
•
an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•
a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.
The occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Rising interest rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock’s AUM and base fees to decline and introduce volatility to the Company’s net income and operating cash flows.
A number of central banks globally have recently begun increasing interest rates following a prolonged period of historically low rates. Rising interest rates may, among other things: (i) cause the value of BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate, creating volatility in base fees, net income, and operating cash flows; (ii) adversely affect the liquidity in bonds and fixed-income products, resulting in lower performance, yield and base fees; (iii) introduce volatility to, or negatively impact the value of, BlackRock’s marked-to-market investments; (iv) result in investors withdrawing funds from lower yielding products to pursue investments with higher rates of return; (v) lead to BlackRock’s private credit clients experiencing difficulties in making higher interest payments, which may result in increased credit costs and potential provisions for loan losses and charge-offs for BlackRock’s funds; and (vi) make it more difficult for BlackRock’s funds to obtain financing for new investments, refinance existing investments or liquidate debt investments, which could negatively impact such funds’ investment returns, revenues and liquidity. In the event that rising interest rates have any such effect, it may cause BlackRock’s AUM and base fees to decline and introduce volatility to the Company’s net income and operating cash flows.
In addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees.
BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund’s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, have altered the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to spend more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with products and services offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
The sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are an important element of BlackRock’s competitive success. Aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform flexibility or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in Aladdin.
The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance.
Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.
At December 31, 2018, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $2.4 billion in its investments (see “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs”) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as other minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline.
Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses.
BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks.
BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.
BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2018 and subject to this type of indemnification was $201 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $214 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2018. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, as well as regulatory restrictions on the Company’s ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension, European fragmentation, unrest in the Middle East, Brexit negotiations and terrorist activity, as well as acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. These increased risks, as well as heightened security measures or changes in geopolitical policy in response thereto, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity, as well as loss of life and property damage. Global unrest, international conflicts or acts of terror, as well as continued instability in the geopolitical environment, may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Risks Related to INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE
Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:
•
client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors;
•
client shifts to products that charge lower fees;
•
the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;
•
reduced, minimal or no performance fees;
•
an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•
a decrease in investment returns on seed and co-investment capital.
Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.
A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $412 million, or 3%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company’s performance fee generating assets. In particular, as BlackRock takes on more advisory assignments for illiquid investments, performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products.
Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.
BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions, as well as any failure of BlackRock’s governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models or model assumptions, could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock’s business and reputation.
TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS
A failure in BlackRock’s operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth. In addition, despite BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.
A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack including a phishing scam, malware, or denial-of-service attack, or an internally caused incident, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, BlackRock’s increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock’s control. BlackRock’s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.
There have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information and the unauthorized transfer of customer funds, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. BlackRock has
been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and cause financial losses. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures, to strengthen its computer systems, processes, software, technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock’s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock’s systems.
In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.
Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations and could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
BlackRock relies on its ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. The analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin analytical calculations. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or information, or disruption of such information flows, could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients.
Continuing enhancements to Aladdin’s capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.
The operation of BlackRock’s Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, developing new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including to address client or regulatory requirements. Such updates and expansion have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to provide the operational resiliency and stability to support the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
In addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may indirectly expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions.
Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.
BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.
BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to additional costs or operational risk.
BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services require continued innovative efforts on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. A failure to successfully manage these risks may have an adverse impact on BlackRock’s reputation or cause the Company’s costs to fluctuate, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.
BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams,
making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures and acquiring investment management businesses and other small and medium-sized companies or divisions of companies. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities. Any failure to identify and mitigate these risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation, may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, and may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry. Moreover, there can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent or realize other intended benefits from inorganic transactions.
Investments in real assets such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.
Investments in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. These may include:
•
construction risks, including labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;
•
accidents, adverse weather, force majeure or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control;
•
personal injury or property damage;
•
failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;
•
exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;
•
environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;
•
changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;
•
the financial resources of tenants; and
•
contingent liabilities on disposition of assets.
The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock’s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management’s attention away from BlackRock’s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks.
As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Operating outside the United States (“US”) may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher compliance costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL
The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Many of BlackRock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock’s operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, or errors in judgment. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Although BlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, it cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks. BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which could cause adverse publicity, costly regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company’s reputation and workplace culture, the immigration policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.
In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, if BlackRock’s share price were to decrease, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.
Risks Related to KEY THIRD-PARTY Relationships
The impairment or failure of third parties may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts BlackRock manages to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations. Any such impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts managed by BlackRock, which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key vendors could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market data, market indices, transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients’ investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock’s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all, which may expose BlackRock to significant costs and/or operational difficulties and impair its ability to conduct or grow its business. Moreover, while BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. In addition, BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another. For example, BlackRock is currently in the process of moving custody services on more than $1 trillion of client assets from State Street Corp. to JPMorgan Chase & Co., the migration of which is expected to be complete during the first half of 2019. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex, and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company’s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully, if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock.
Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s Exchange-Traded Fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.
BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value. The net asset value of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF’s holdings. The trading price of the ETF’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. While an ETF’s creation/redemption feature and the arbitrage mechanism are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the ETF’s net asset value, exchange prices may deviate significantly from the ETF’s net asset value. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, inability or unwillingness of market markers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively, or significant market volatility. Although BlackRock and other large issuers of ETFs are working with market participants to seek to enhance US equity market resiliency, there can be no assurance that structural reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate significantly from an ETF’s net asset value, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world.
BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. In addition, many of BlackRock’s legal entities may be subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and the UK Bribery Act. BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the General Data Protection Regulation, which expands data protection rules for individuals within the European Union (“EU”) and for personal data exported outside the EU. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company’s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted.
BlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BlackRock’s bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see “Item 1 - Business - Regulation.”
Regulatory reforms in the United States expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
In recent years a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the United States, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. Further changes to financial services regulation may arise, including in connection with the executive order issued in February 2017 (the “Executive Order”) directing the US Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) to identify laws, treaties, regulations and other policies that promote or inhibit certain core principles for financial regulation, that may directly or indirectly impact BlackRock’s business or operating activities. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, or may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the United States, see “Item 1 - Business - Regulation,” key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:
•
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC and its staff are engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. In so doing, it has adopted rules that include (i) new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain US registered funds; (ii) enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers; and (iii) implementing liquidity risk management programs for ETFs and open-end funds, other than money market funds. These rules, many of which are currently in an implementation period, will increase BlackRock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock’s growth.
•
SEC ETF Rule: In addition, in June 2018, the SEC issued a proposed rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) known as the “ETF Rule”. The ETF Rule is intended to establish a clear and consistent framework that allows most ETFs operating under the Investment Company Act to come to market without applying for individual exemptive orders.
•
SEC Standards of Conduct Proposal: In April 2018, the SEC published a package of proposed rules and a proposed interpretation (collectively, the “Proposals”) intended to improve the retail investor experience and provide greater clarity regarding customers’ relationships with broker-dealers and investment advisers. The Proposals would: (i) create a principles-based standard of conduct for broker-dealers and require broker-dealers to act in the “best interest” of retail customers; (ii) “clarify and reaffirm” investment advisers’ fiduciary obligations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”); and (iii) create additional disclosure obligations for broker-dealers and investment advisers to help retail investors better understand relationships with investment professionals. The
SEC also proposed the introduction of an enhanced disclosure regime, in addition to certain new compliance obligations for investment advisers that currently apply only to broker-dealers. If adopted without change, the Proposals could increase BlackRock’s disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain educational and other services to its clients.
•
The Volcker Rule: Provisions of Dodd-Frank referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the Bank Holding Company Act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve has taken the position that PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock, which is approximately 22%, causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule. Conformance with the Volcker Rule may require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in its covered funds, which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions.
•
Designation as a systemically important financial institution (“SIFI”): The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs. The FSOC’s most recent statements generally indicate that it is focused on products and activities, rather than entity-specific designation, in its review of asset managers. The Treasury Report on asset management, issued in October 2017 pursuant to the Executive Order, also expressed this view. In addition, in November 2017, Treasury made recommendations concerning the process by which the FSOC designates nonbanks as SIFIs, further supporting a products and activities approach to addressing risks in asset management. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI under Dodd-Frank, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.
Regulatory reforms in the United States could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be costly, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
BlackRock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the United States and the Company may be affected by a number of proposed or fully or partially implemented reform initiatives in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty, including:
•
British Exit from the EU: Following the June 2016 vote to exit the EU, the United Kingdom (“UK”) served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29, 2017 to initiate the two-year long process of exiting from the EU, commonly referred to as ""Brexit"". There is substantial uncertainty surrounding the terms upon which the UK will ultimately exit the EU. As a result, the UK’s relationship with the EU, as well as whether an agreement will be reached by the March 29, 2019 exit deadline, remains unclear. Moreover, the passage of time without a resolution in place has become a source of economic, political and regulatory instability. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. These steps, many of which have been time-consuming and costly, are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, BlackRock may experience organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
•
Reform of EU investment markets: The European Commission has revised the Directive governing the provision of investment services in Europe (“MiFID”) and introduced an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The Regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms, which came into force in January 2018, are substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. New disclosure and reporting obligations have been introduced, together with restrictions on how research may be funded and the nature of payments that may be provided to distributors. MiFID II, together with other market structure reforms, force more derivatives to be traded on-exchange and introduce new commodity derivatives position limits. The broad nature of the MiFID II reforms impact BlackRock’s product development, client servicing and distribution models. In particular, additional disclosures are required to be made in respect of costs and fees BlackRock charges to certain of its clients. MiFID II also impacts the ability of certain of BlackRock’s distribution partners to accept commissions from BlackRock for distributing BlackRock funds.
•
Revised EU capital requirements: In December 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms. The new legislative package is expected to come into effect in 2020 once agreed by the European Council and Parliament. Once implemented, any new requirements could result in significant changes to the amount of regulatory capital that BlackRock is required to hold in the EU.
•
EU market access: In September 2017, the European Commission issued a proposal requiring that all third-country outsourcing, delegation and risk transfer arrangements be assessed by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”). If enacted, the proposal would transfer to ESMA the ability of EU Member States to authorize the outsourcing of asset management activities beyond the EU’s borders. While the proposal remains under discussion, if enacted, it could significantly impact asset management firms with non-EU operations, including BlackRock, and it may affect the Company’s ability to delegate fund management, supporting activity and/or costs associated with such delegation.
•
EU money market fund reform: In June 2017, the European Commission published new Money Market Regulations (the “MM Regulations”) which took effect in January 2019. The MM Regulations are intended to reduce perceived risks of EU-based money market products. The MM Regulations limit the use of constant net asset value money market funds to those holding only government money market instruments and introduce a new category of “low volatility net asset value” money market funds and two types of “variable net asset value funds”. All categories of money market funds are subject to reinforced liquidity requirements, as well as safeguards such as liquidity fees and redemption gates. The MM Regulations require fundamental changes to many of the Company’s money market funds offered in the EU and may reduce their attractiveness to investors.
•
Senior Managers and Certification Regime: In the UK, the FCA is extending the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”) to all financial services firms beginning December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.
•
UK asset management market study: The FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer “value” to investors. Beginning in 2020, the Company will be required annually to disclose the conclusions of its assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If “value” has not been provided to consumers, the Company will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA’s final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and it will consider various remedies in 2019, including mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA’s remedies could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.
•
Designation as a systemically important financial institution: The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) is considering potential systemic risk related to asset management; statements made by these organizations have generally indicated that they are, at this time, focused on products and activities, rather than designation, in their approach to the review of asset managers. The FSB has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of non-bank non-insurers in the future to address “residual risks”. Any measures applied in relation to a global systemically important financial institution (“G-SIFI”) designation from the FSB would need to be implemented through existing regulatory processes and procedures by relevant national authorities.
International regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s internationally-based clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US and non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock’s shareholders, which could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.
In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.
As BlackRock’s business continues to grow, the Company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. In addition, the SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts. BlackRock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the Company fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, or penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCC regulation and capital requirements. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations. In addition, as described in “Item 1 - Business-Regulation”, as of December 31, 2018, PNC owned approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which may subject BlackRock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC. The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve has taken the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule, that are more restrictive than those the Company is subject to under other applicable laws, as well as the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve, which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any effort by BlackRock to contest a control determination by the Federal Reserve may be costly and complex and may not result in a reversal of such determination.
Failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Of note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership.
As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as “common ownership”. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. Additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries managed by asset managers with higher consumer prices and escalating executive compensation, among other things. In the US, the FTC over the course of late 2018 held hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century, one of which included a discussion of common ownership. In the EU, there are indications that the European Commission’s Directorate General for Competition may discuss common ownership. There is substantial literature highlighting the benefits of index investing, as well as casting doubt on the assumptions, methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments. Some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on stakes managed by asset managers that, if enacted into policy measures, could adversely affect BlackRock’s business operations, reputation or financial condition.
New tax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US authorities. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) was enacted. As proposed regulations and new guidance are released, the Company continues to assess the impact of tax reform.
In addition, certain EU Member States have enacted financial transaction taxes (“FTTs”), which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions, and the European Commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and on clients’ performance results.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
RISKS RELATED TO BLACKROCK’S SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER
PNC owns 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Future sales or distributions of BlackRock’s common stock in the public market by the Company or PNC could adversely affect the trading price of BlackRock’s common stock.
As of December 31, 2018, PNC owned 22% of the Company’s capital stock. Sales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of BlackRock’s common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales or distributions might occur, may cause the market price of BlackRock’s common stock to decline.
PNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC.
As discussed in BlackRock’s proxy statement, PNC has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board.
As discussed in BlackRock’s proxy statement, pursuant to BlackRock’s stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:
•
appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock;
•
any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than the persons holding such majority of the total voting power prior to the occurrence of any such merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock;
•
any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRock’s consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;
•
any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis;
•
except for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;
•
any amendment to BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or
•
any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.
Additionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC:
•
any sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenue of which, together with the annualized revenue of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenue of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;
•
for so long as BlackRock is deemed a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the Bank Holding Company Act;
•
any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC;
•
any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or
•
a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.",,,,,4302.0,,0.0,16:25:04,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

(5) Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs. SUMMARY OF REVENUE Highlights • Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue decreased $142 million from the first quarter of 2018, primarily driven by the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange on average AUM and the impact of strategic pricing investments, partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions and organic growth. Securities lending revenue of $148 million in the current quarter compared with $155 million in first quarter of 2018. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue increased $26 million from the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by the impact of higher average AUM and higher securities lending revenue, partially offset by the effect of two less days in the quarter. Securities lending revenue of $148 million in the current quarter compared with $129 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. • Performance fees decreased $44 million from the first quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternatives and long-only products, partially offset by higher revenue from illiquid alternatives. Performance fees decreased $74 million from the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to a seasonally higher number of funds with a performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. • Technology services revenue increased $20 million from the first quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin. • Advisory and other revenue decreased $22 million from the first quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting lower earnings from an equity method investment. Advisory and other revenue decreased $32 million from the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments. SUMMARY OF OPERATING EXPENSE Highlights • Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $57 million from the first quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation, driven in part by lower operating income. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $44 million from the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to the effect of additional grants at the end of January 2019, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, driven in part by lower performance fees and operating income. • General and administration expense increased $5 million from the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher technology expense, partially offset by the impact of product launch costs recorded in the first quarter of 2018. General and administration expense decreased $61 million from the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower professional services expense, and the impact of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. • In the fourth quarter of 2018, a restructuring charge of $60 million, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, was recorded in connection with an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce. INCOME TAX EXPENSE Highlights • First quarter 2019 and 2018 income tax expense included $22 million and $56 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of each respective year. SUMMARY AND RECONCILIATION OF US GAAP NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) TO NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), AS ADJUSTED (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. (2) Management believes nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to results. For more information on other as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP see notes (1) through (3) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on pages 10-11. (3) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions. (4) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to equity and fixed income investments. (5) Amounts primarily include noncash pre-tax gains related to the revaluation of certain minority strategic investments. RECONCILIATION OF US GAAP OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN TO OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN, AS ADJUSTED See note (1) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on page 11 for more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP. RECONCILIATION OF US GAAP NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO BLACKROCK TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO BLACKROCK, AS ADJUSTED See notes (2) and (3) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on page 11 for more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (unaudited) BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows: (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. • Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. A restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. • Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to third parties. Management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the Company’s products. BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to distribution and servicing costs as a proxy for such offsetting revenue. (2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and restructuring charge. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the restructuring charge and PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. (3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

OVERVIEW
BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $6.52 trillion of AUM at March 31, 2019. With approximately 14,700 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.

Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current period classifications.
United Kingdom Exit from European Union
Following the June 2016 vote to exit the EU, the United Kingdom (“UK”) served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29, 2017 to initiate the process of exiting from the EU, commonly referred to as ""Brexit"". At the Emergency EU Summit held on April 10, 2019, an agreement was reached to extend the deadline by which the UK is required to exit the EU to October 31, 2019. If a withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU is ratified prior to October 31, 2019, the UK will withdraw from the EU on the first day of the month following such agreement.
Substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the terms upon which the UK will ultimately exit the EU. As a result, the UK’s relationship with the EU, as well as whether a withdrawal agreement will be reached, remains unclear. Moreover, the passage of time without a resolution in place has become a source of economic, political and regulatory instability. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. These steps, many of which have been time-consuming and costly, are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, BlackRock may experience organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Acquisition
In March 2019, the Company announced that it made a binding offer and entered into an exclusive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interests of eFront Holding SAS (“eFront”), a leading alternative investment management software and solutions provider for approximately $1.3 billion, excluding settlement of eFront’s outstanding debt. On April 30, 2019, the Company and eFront shareholders subsequently signed a definitive purchase agreement in respect of the acquisition. The Company believes the acquisition of eFront will expand Aladdin’s illiquid alternative capabilities and provide whole-portfolio technology solutions to clients. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019.

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018
GAAP. Operating income of $1,233 million decreased $142 million and operating margin of 36.8% decreased 160 bps from the first quarter of 2018. The decline in operating income and operating margin reflected the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange on base fees, partially offset by lower employee compensation and benefits and volume-related expense. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) increased $139 million from the first quarter of 2018, driven by higher marks on un-hedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments.
First quarter 2019 and 2018 income tax expense included $22 million and $56 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of each respective year. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.07, or 1%, from the first quarter of 2018, driven primarily by lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter, partially offset by higher nonoperating income and the benefit of share repurchases.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,233 million decreased $145 million and operating margin of 41.9% decreased 145 bps from the first quarter of 2018. Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.09, or 1%, from the first quarter of 2018.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP“).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting for different distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, includes a non-GAAP expense adjustment. In the three months ended March 31, 2018, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced by the Company’s distribution and servicing costs, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income. Distribution and servicing costs are direct payments to third parties for the distribution and servicing of retail products and may vary between periods based on the type of investment product sold and geographic location. The Company recovers these costs through revenue received from its retail products.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation.
For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustment. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
(3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM increased $539.5 billion to $6.52 trillion at March 31, 2019, driven by net market appreciation and positive net inflows.
Net market appreciation of $469.2 billion was primarily driven by higher US and global equity markets.
Long-term net inflows of $59.0 billion included $30.7 billion and $29.1 billion from iShares ETFs and institutional clients, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $0.8 billion from retail clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $30.7 billion were led by fixed income ETFs, which generated $32.2 billion of net inflows, across high yield, emerging market bonds and treasuries. iShares ETFs net inflows reflected $19.5 billion and $11.2 billion of net inflows into Core and non-Core ETFs, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $16.7 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $14.6 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $15.4 billion were driven by active fixed income, alternative and multi-asset net inflows of $13.0 billion, $5.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, partially offset by active equity net outflows of $5.5 billion. Active fixed income net inflows reflected strong activity in the insurance client channel. Alternative net inflows of $5.3 billion reflected net flows into illiquid alternatives, led by infrastructure, real estate, private credit and the first close of Long Term Private Capital (“LTPC”), a perpetual, direct private equity fund.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $13.8 billion were led by fixed income net inflows of $28.8 billion, reflecting continued demand for liability-driven investment solutions, partially offset by equity net outflows of $15.3 billion.
•
Retail net outflows of $0.8 billion reflected net outflows in international equities and world allocation strategies, partially offset by strength in BlackRock’s municipal fixed income franchise and event-driven liquid alternative funds.
Cash management AUM increased to $455.3 billion, driven by positive net inflows of $5.7 billion.
AUM increased $5.7 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound, partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro.

(1) Amounts include net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction.

(3) Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
(4) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.
(5) Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM increased $198.4 billion to $6.52 trillion at March 31, 2019, driven by net market appreciation, net inflows and net AUM added from strategic transactions, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market appreciation of $162.2 billion included $99.3 billion from equity products, driven by higher US equity markets and $43.8 billion from fixed income strategies.
Long-term net inflows of $127.7 billion were comprised of net inflows of $163.6 billion and $1.6 billion from iShares ETFs and retail clients, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $37.5 billion from institutional clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $163.6 billion reflected $93.4 billion and $70.2 billion of net inflows into Core and non-Core ETFs, respectively. Equity net inflows of $81.5 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $79.9 billion were led by flows into treasuries, investment grade corporate bond and emerging markets debt ETFs.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $12.9 billion reflected active multi-asset and alternative net inflows of $18.6 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively, partially offset by active equity and fixed income net outflows of $13.1 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Multi-asset net inflows were driven by ongoing demand for the LifePath® target-date series and outsourced chief investment officer mandates. Alternatives net inflows were led by flows into illiquid alternatives, including infrastructure, real estate and the previously mentioned first close of LTPC.
•
Retail net inflows of $1.6 billion reflected net inflows of $18.8 billion in the United States, partially offset by net outflows of $17.2 billion internationally. Retail net inflows were led by fixed income net inflows of $7.4 billion, reflecting inflows into municipal and core bond funds, partially offset by net outflows from emerging market debt and unconstrained strategies.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $50.3 billion were primarily driven by equity net outflows of $100.0 billion, linked to client asset allocation, re-balancing and cash needs, partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $48.7 billion, led by continued demand for liability-driven investment fixed income solutions.
Cash management AUM increased to $455.3 billion, primarily due to positive net inflows and net market appreciation, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
AUM decreased $122.7 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound and the Euro.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2018
Revenue decreased $237 million, or 7%, from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily driven by lower base fees.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $2,805 million decreased $142 million from $2,947 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily driven by the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange on average AUM and the impact of strategic pricing investments, partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions and organic growth. Securities lending revenue was $148 million in the current quarter compared with $155 million in the first quarter of 2018.
Investment advisory performance fees of $26 million decreased $44 million from $70 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternatives and long-only products, partially offset by higher revenue from illiquid alternatives.
Technology services revenue of $204 million increased $20 million from $184 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin.
Advisory and other revenue of $49 million decreased $22 million from $71 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily reflecting lower earnings from an equity method investment.

GAAP. Expense decreased $95 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018, driven primarily by lower employee compensation and benefits expense and lower volume-related expense.
Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $57 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation, driven in part by lower operating income. Employees at March 31, 2019 totaled approximately 14,700 compared with approximately 14,000 at March 31, 2018.
General and administration expense increased $5 million from the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily driven by higher technology expense, partially offset by the impact of product launch costs recorded during the three months ended Marched 31, 2018.
As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, decreased $92 million, or 4%, to $2,113 million from $2,205 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in total expense, as adjusted, is driven primarily by lower employee compensation and benefits expense and lower volume-related expense.

BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Balance Sheet
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as voting rights entities (“VREs”) and VIEs, (collectively, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2018 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 included $42 million and $59 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated VREs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended March 31, 2019).
Accounts receivable at March 31, 2019 increased $114 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher base fees and securities lending receivables. Investments were $1,917 million at March 31, 2019 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $17 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including operating lease ROU assets and property and equipment) increased $695 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the recognition of the operating lease ROU assets related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially
offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a decrease in current taxes receivable.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at March 31, 2019 decreased $1,258 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to 2018 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by 2019 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at March 31, 2019 decreased $67 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower current income taxes payables. Other liabilities increased $776 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the recognition of the operating lease liabilities related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets). Net deferred income tax liabilities at March 31, 2019 increased $83 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation and investment income.
Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs
The Company’s investments and investments of consolidated VIEs (collectively, “Total Investments”) were $1,917 million and $2,592 million, respectively, at March 31 2019. Total Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s Total Investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of Total Investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents Total Investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of Total Investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of Total Investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $72 million and primarily reflected $48 million of investment purchases and $58 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $27 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $2,357 million, primarily resulting from $1.8 billion of share repurchases, including $1.6 billion in open market transactions reflecting the impact of a $1.3 billion private transaction and $222 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $556 million of cash dividend payments.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows:

Amount does not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals, which are paid in the first quarter.
Total liquidity resources decreased $2,394 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2018 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.8 billion reflecting the impact of a $1.3 billion private transaction, cash dividend payments of $556 million, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities.
A significant portion of the Company’s $3,491 million of Total Investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. In January 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for a total up to approximately 9.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 3.8 million common shares in open market transactions under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.6 billion, including a $1.3 billion private transaction that closed on March 25, 2019. The Company has now completed its targeted level of share repurchases for the year, but will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise. At March 31, 2019, there were 6.1 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.8 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in March 2019 to extend the maturity date to March 2024 (the “2019 credit facility”). The 2019 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2019 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2019 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at March 31, 2019. The 2019 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At March 31, 2019, the Company had no amount outstanding under the credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2019 credit facility. At March 31, 2019, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At March 31, 2019, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $5.0 billion. See Note 13, Borrowings, in the 2018 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company paid approximately $29 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at March 31, 2019 were as follows:

(1)
The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of March 31, 2019.
In April 2019, the Company issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on April 30, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2029 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding all or a portion of the purchase price of the Company’s recently announced acquisition of eFront, repayment of a portion of the 5.00% Notes in December 2019 or repayment of borrowings under its commercial paper program. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing October 30, 2019, and is approximately $33 million per year. The 2029 Notes may be redeemed prior to January 30, 2029 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at par thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2029 Notes.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At March 31, 2019, the Company had $635 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated VIEs. These funds include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at March 31, 2019 totaled $275 million and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments, or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At March 31, 2019, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $214 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $227 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at March 31, 2019. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at March 31, 2019.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the condensed consolidated financial statements, including information regarding the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2018 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. See Note 5, Consolidated Voting Rights Entities, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Variable Interest Entities, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Leases. The Company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. The identification of whether a contract contains a lease requires judgment, including determining whether there are identified assets in the contract and whether the Company has control over such identified assets.
Fixed lease payments are included in ROU assets and lease liabilities on the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”). Management judgment is required in determining a Company’s IBR, including assessing the Company’s credit rating using various financial metrics, including revenue, operating margin and revenue growth, and, as appropriate, performing market analysis of yields on publicly traded bonds (secured or unsecured) of comparable companies. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on leases.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are
highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these funds. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments/investments of consolidated VIEs or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had $327 million and $293 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 14, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.

OVERVIEW
BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $6.84 trillion of AUM at June 30, 2019. With approximately 16,000 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.
BlackRock’s diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® ETFs, separate accounts, collective investment trusts and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin®, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix and FutureAdvisor, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients.
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors.
BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management and technology service relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through third-party distribution relationships, including financial professionals and pension consultants.

Certain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current period classifications.
United Kingdom Exit from European Union
Following the June 2016 vote to exit the European Union (“EU”), the United Kingdom (“UK”) served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29, 2017 to initiate the process of exiting from the EU, commonly referred to as ""Brexit"". At the Emergency EU Summit held on April 10, 2019, an agreement was reached to extend the deadline by which the UK is required to exit the EU to October 31, 2019. If a withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU is ratified prior to October 31, 2019, the UK will withdraw from the EU on the first day of the month following such agreement.
Substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the terms upon which the UK will ultimately exit the EU. As a result, the UK’s relationship with the EU, as well as whether a withdrawal agreement will be reached, remains unclear. Moreover, the passage of time without a resolution in place has become a source of economic, political and regulatory instability. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. These steps, many of which have been time-consuming and costly, are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, BlackRock may experience organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Acquisition
On May 10, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of eFront Holding SAS (“eFront Transaction” or “eFront”), a leading alternative investment management software and solutions provider for approximately $1.3 billion, excluding the settlement of eFront’s outstanding debt. The acquisition of eFront will expand Aladdin’s illiquid alternative capabilities and enable BlackRock to provide individual alternative or whole-portfolio technology solutions to clients.

THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
GAAP. Operating income of $1,278 million decreased $162 million and operating margin of 36.3% decreased 360 bps from the second quarter of 2018. The decline in operating income and operating margin reflected lower base fees, driven in part by lower securities lending revenue, and lower performance fees, partially offset by growth in technology services revenue. The decline also reflected $61 million of product launch costs associated with the close of the $1.4 billion BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II, a closed-end active equity fund. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) increased $76 million from the second quarter of 2018, primarily driven by the revaluation of certain minority investments and higher marks on un-hedged fixed income seed capital investments.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.21, or 3%, from the second quarter of 2018, driven primarily by lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter, partially offset by higher nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,278 million decreased $165 million and operating margin of 43.1% decreased 210 bps from the second quarter of 2018. Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.25, or 4%, from the second quarter of 2018.
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
GAAP. Operating income of $2,511 million decreased $304 million and operating margin of 36.6% decreased 260 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decline in operating income and operating margin reflected lower base and performance fees, and lower advisory and other revenue, partially offset by higher technology services revenue and lower employee compensation and benefits, and volume-related expense. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2019 also included the previously mentioned $61 million of product launch costs associated with the close of a closed-end fund. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI increased $215 million from the six months ended June 30, 2018, driven by higher marks on un-hedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments.
Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 included $22 million and $58 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of each respective year. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.28, or 2%, from the six months ended June 30, 2018, driven primarily by lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $2,511 million decreased $310 million and operating margin of 42.5% decreased 220 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2018. Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.34, or 3%, from the six months ended June 30, 2018.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP“).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting for different distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, includes a non-GAAP expense adjustment. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced by the Company’s distribution and servicing costs, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income. Distribution and servicing costs are direct payments to third parties for the distribution and servicing of retail products and may vary between periods based on the type of investment product sold and geographic location. The Company recovers these costs through revenue received from its retail products.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation.
For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustment. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
(3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

AUM increased $327.1 billion to $6.84 trillion at June 30, 2019, driven by net market appreciation and positive net inflows.
Net market appreciation of $175.6 billion was primarily driven by higher US and global equity markets and fixed income appreciation.
Long-term net inflows of $125.4 billion included $87.4 billion, $36.1 billion and $1.9 billion from institutional clients, iShares ETFs and retail clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $73.2 billion were driven by active fixed income inflows of $59.3 billion, reflecting two significant strategic client mandates. Active multi-asset net inflows reflected continued growth in LifePath® target-date series and active equity net inflows were primarily into quantitative strategies.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $36.1 billion reflected continued growth in Core, Fixed Income, Factor and Sustainable ETFs. Core and non-Core iShares ETFs saw net inflows of $19.7 billion and $16.4 billion, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $27.2 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $8.6 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $14.2 billion were led by fixed income net inflows of $14.2 billion, reflecting continued demand for liability-driven investment solutions.
•
Retail net inflows of $1.9 billion reflected net inflows of $6.6 billion in the United States, partially offset by net outflows of $4.7 billion internationally. Retail inflows reflected strength in municipal fixed income funds, event-driven liquid alternative funds and the close of the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II closed-end fund.
Cash management AUM increased to $481.2 billion, driven by net inflows of $25.6 billion.
AUM increased $0.5 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the Euro and Japanese yen, partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound.

AUM increased $866.7 billion to $6.84 trillion at June 30, 2019, driven by net market appreciation and net inflows.
Net market appreciation of $644.8 billion was driven by higher US and global equity markets and fixed income appreciation.
Long-term net inflows of $184.4 billion included $116.5 billion, $66.8 billion and $1.1 billion from institutional clients, iShares ETFs and retail clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $88.5 billion were primarily driven by active fixed income, multi-asset and alternative net inflows of $72.3 billion, $12.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. Active fixed income net inflows included the previously mentioned significant strategic client mandates and active multi-asset net inflows reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date franchise and asset allocation strategies. Alternatives net inflows were led by flows into illiquid alternatives, including infrastructure, real estate and the first close of Long Term Private Capital (“LTPC”), a perpetual, direct private equity fund.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $66.8 billion were led by fixed income ETFs, which generated $63.7 billion of net inflows, across treasuries, high yield and emerging markets debt ETFs. iShares ETFs reflected $39.2 billion and $27.6 billion of net inflows into Core and non-Core ETFs, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $44.0 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $23.2 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $27.9 billion were primarily driven by fixed income net inflows of $43.0 billion, led by continued demand for liability-driven investment fixed income solutions, partially offset by equity net outflows of $14.7 billion.
•
Retail net inflows of $1.1 billion reflected net inflows of $9.8 billion in the United States, partially offset by net outflows of $8.7 billion internationally. Retail net inflows reflected strength in municipal fixed income funds and event-driven liquid alternative funds, as well as the close of the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II closed-end fund, partially offset by net outflows from international equities.
Cash management AUM increased to $481.2 billion, primarily due to net inflows of $31.3 billion.
AUM increased $6.2 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the Canadian dollar and Japanese yen, partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound and Euro.

(1) Amounts include net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction.
(2) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(3) Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
(4) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.
(5) Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM increased $542.8 billion to $6.84 trillion at June 30, 2019, driven by net market appreciation, net inflows and net AUM added from strategic transactions, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market appreciation of $287.6 billion was driven by higher US equity markets and fixed income appreciation.
Long-term net inflows of $238.6 billion were comprised of net inflows of $181.9 billion and $58.7 billion from iShares ETFs and institutional clients, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $2.0 billion from retail clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $181.9 billion reflected $92.7 billion and $89.2 billion of net inflows into Core and non-Core ETFs, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $129.7 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $40.5 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs. Fixed income net inflows of $95.5 billion were led by flows into treasuries, investment grade corporate bond and emerging markets debt ETFs. Equity net inflows of $84.3 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $81.4 billion reflected active fixed income, multi-asset and alternative net inflows of $58.6 billion, $20.5 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, partially offset by active equity net outflows of $9.0 billion. Active fixed income net inflows included the previously mentioned significant strategic client mandates and active multi-asset net inflows reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date series and asset allocation strategies. Alternatives net inflows were led by flows into illiquid alternatives, including infrastructure, real estate and LTPC.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $22.7 billion were primarily driven by equity net outflows of $78.4 billion, linked to client asset allocation, re-balancing and cash needs, partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $55.7 billion, led by continued demand for liability-driven investment fixed income solutions.
•
Retail net outflows of $2.0 billion reflected net outflows of $19.1 billion internationally, partially offset by net inflows of $17.1 billion in the United States. Retail net outflows reflected net outflows from international equities and world allocation strategies, partially offset by net inflows into fixed income products and event-driven liquid alternative funds, as well as the close of the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II closed-end fund.
Cash management AUM increased to $481.2 billion, primarily due to net inflows of $22.9 billion.
AUM decreased $34.6 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound and Euro, partially offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the Japanese yen.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2018
Revenue decreased $81 million, or 2%, from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by lower base fees, performance fees and advisory and other revenue, partially offset by higher technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $2,903 million decreased $41 million from $2,944 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by lower securities lending revenue, as well as the negative impact of divergent equity beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, mix shift toward fixed income and cash, and strategic price changes to certain products, partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions and organic growth. Securities lending revenue of $150 million in the current quarter compared with $183 million in the second quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting reduced borrowing demand, lower cash spreads and reduced European seasonal demand.
Investment advisory performance fees of $64 million decreased $27 million from $91 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenue from long-only equity products.
Technology services revenue of $237 million increased $39 million from $198 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin and the impact of the eFront acquisition.
Advisory and other revenue of $53 million decreased $25 million from $78 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily reflecting lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2018
Revenue decreased $318 million, or 4%, from the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by lower base fees, performance fees and advisory and other revenue, partially offset by higher technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $5,708 million decreased $183 million from $5,891 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by the impact of negative markets and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, mix shift toward fixed income and cash, strategic price changes to certain products and lower securities lending revenue, partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions and organic growth. Securities lending revenue of $298 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared with $338 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily reflecting reduced European seasonal demand and lower cash spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $90 million decreased $71 million from $161 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenue from long-only equity products and liquid alternatives, partially offset by higher revenue from illiquid alternatives.
Technology services revenue of $441 million increased $59 million from $382 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin and the impact of the eFront acquisition.
Advisory and other revenue of $102 million decreased $47 million from $149 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily reflecting lower earnings from an equity method investment and lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments.

GAAP. Expense increased $81 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by higher general and administrative expense, which reflected product launch costs and acquisition-related expense in the current quarter.
General and administration expense increased $77 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to $59 million of previously mentioned product launch costs. The increase also reflected contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions and professional fees incurred in connection with the eFront Transaction.
Amortization of intangible assets expense increased $14 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily reflecting amortization of intangible assets associated with the eFront Transaction and the acquisition of TCP.
As Adjusted. Expense, as adjusted, increased $84 million, or 4%, to $2,246 million from $2,162 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in total expense, as adjusted, is driven primarily by higher general and administrative expense, including the previously described product launch costs, and amortization of intangible assets.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2018

BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Balance Sheet
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as voting rights entities (“VREs”) and VIEs, (collectively, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2018 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

Amount includes approximately $4.2 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles.
The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 included $13 million and $59 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated VREs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended June 30, 2019).
Accounts receivable at June 30, 2019 increased $206 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher technology services and base fees receivables. Investments were $1,989 million at June 30, 2019 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $1,623 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the eFront Transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and property and equipment) increased $966 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the recognition of the operating lease ROU assets related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance, and an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities).
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at June 30, 2019 decreased $910 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to 2018 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by 2019 incentive compensation accruals. Other liabilities increased $757 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the recognition of the operating lease liabilities related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), partially offset by contingent liability payments in connection with certain prior acquisitions. Net deferred income tax liabilities at June 30, 2019 increased $254 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with the eFront Transaction, stock-based compensation and investment income.
Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs
The Company’s investments and investments of consolidated VIEs (collectively, “Total Investments”) were $1,989 million and $2,431 million, respectively, at June 30, 2019. Total Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s Total Investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of Total Investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents Total Investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of Total Investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of Total Investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $1,566 million and primarily reflected $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the eFront Transaction, $73 million of investment purchases and $105 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $71 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $2,010 million, primarily resulting from $1.8 billion of share repurchases, including $300 million in open market transactions, a $1.3 billion private transaction and $229 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $1.1 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $992 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows:

(2)
The Company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities.
(3)
Amount does not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals, which are paid in the first quarter.
Total liquidity resources decreased $2,336 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2018 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.8 billion, reflecting the impact of a $1.3 billion private transaction, approximately $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the eFront Transaction, and cash dividend payments of $1.1 billion, partially offset by $992 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings and cash flows from other operating activities.
A significant portion of the Company’s $3,614 million of Total Investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. In January 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for a total up to approximately 9.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 3.8 million common shares under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.6 billion, including a $1.3 billion private transaction that closed on March 25, 2019. The Company has now completed its targeted level of share repurchases for the year, but will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise. At June 30, 2019, there were 6.1 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.8 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in March 2019 to extend the maturity date to March 2024 (the “2019 credit facility”). The 2019 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2019 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2019 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at June 30, 2019. The 2019 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At June 30, 2019, the Company had no amount outstanding under the credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2019 credit facility. At June 30, 2019, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At June 30, 2019, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $6.0 billion. See Note 13, Borrowings, in the 2018 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company paid approximately $92 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at June 30, 2019 were as follows:

The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of June 30, 2019.
In April 2019, the Company issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on April 30, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). Interest is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing October 30, 2019, and is approximately $33 million per year. The 2029 Notes may be redeemed prior to January 30, 2029 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at par thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2029 Notes.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At June 30, 2019, the Company had $605 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated VIEs. These funds include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at June 30, 2019 totaled $168 million and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments, or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At June 30, 2019, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $205 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $219 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at June 30, 2019. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at June 30, 2019.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, including information regarding the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2018 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. See Note 6, Consolidated Voting Rights Entities, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 7, Variable Interest Entities, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Leases. The Company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. The identification of whether a contract contains a lease requires judgment, including determining whether there are identified assets in the contract and whether the Company has control over such identified assets.
Fixed lease payments are included in ROU assets and lease liabilities on the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”). Management judgment is required in determining a Company’s IBR, including assessing the Company’s credit rating using various financial metrics, including revenue, operating margin and revenue growth, and, as appropriate, performing market analysis of yields on publicly traded bonds (secured or unsecured) of comparable companies. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on leases.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these funds. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments/investments of consolidated VIEs or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had $365 million and $293 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue
and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 15, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.

United Kingdom Exit from European Union
Following the June 2016 vote to exit the European Union (“EU”), the United Kingdom (“UK”) served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29, 2017 to initiate the process of exiting from the EU, commonly referred to as ""Brexit"". At the Emergency EU Summit held on April 10, 2019, an agreement was reached to extend the deadline by which the UK is required to exit the EU to October 31, 2019. The deadline was further extended to January 31, 2020 at the European Council on October 29, 2019.
Substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the terms upon which the UK will ultimately exit the EU. The impact of Brexit will depend in part on any arrangements that are put in place between the UK and the EU and, to the extent they are, whether the UK continues to apply laws that are based on EU legislation. As a result, the UK’s relationship with the EU remains unclear and the passage of time without a resolution in place has become a source of economic, political and regulatory instability.
BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. These steps, many of which have been time-consuming and costly, are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, BlackRock may experience organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Acquisition
On May 10, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of eFront Holding SAS (“eFront Transaction” or “eFront”), a leading alternative investment management software and solutions provider for approximately $1.3 billion, excluding the settlement of eFront’s outstanding debt. The acquisition of eFront expands Aladdin’s illiquid alternative capabilities and enables BlackRock to provide individual alternative or whole-portfolio technology solutions to clients.

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018
GAAP. Operating income of $1,502 million increased $106 million and operating margin of 40.7% increased 170 bps from the third quarter of 2018. Operating income and operating margin reflected higher base fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees and lower transaction-related expense in the current quarter. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) decreased $88 million from the third quarter of 2018, primarily driven by the revaluation of certain minority investments. Nonoperating results for the three months ended September 30, 2018 included a $40 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of the Company’s minority interest in DSP BlackRock Investment Managers Pvt. Ltd. to The DSP Group (“DSP Transaction”).
Third quarter 2018 income tax expense included $90 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to changes in the Company’s organizational entity structure. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.39, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2018, reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter, partially offset by higher operating income and a lower diluted share count.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,502 million increased $102 million and operating margin of 46.0% increased 180 bps from the third quarter of 2018. Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.37, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2018.
NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018
GAAP. Operating income of $4,013 million decreased $198 million and operating margin of 38.0% decreased 110 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decline in operating income and operating margin reflected lower base and performance fees, partially offset by higher technology services revenue and lower employee compensation and benefits and volume-related expense. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 also included $61 million of product launch costs associated with the close of the $1.4 billion BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II, a closed-end active equity fund. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI increased $127 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven by higher marks on unhedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain minority investments. Nonoperating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 included a $40 million pre-tax gain related to the DSP Transaction.
Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 included $22 million and $58 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of each respective year. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 also included the previously mentioned $90 million of discrete tax benefits. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.66, or 3%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2018, driven primarily by lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,013 million decreased $208 million and operating margin of 43.7% decreased 80 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.71, or 3%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP“).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, includes a non-GAAP expense adjustment. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation.
For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustment. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
(3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT
AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

AUM increased $121.5 billion to $6.96 trillion at September 30, 2019, driven by net market appreciation and positive net inflows, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market appreciation of $90.6 billion was primarily driven by fixed income appreciation and higher US equity markets.
Long-term net inflows of $52.3 billion included $41.5 billion, $6.7 billion and $4.1 billion from iShares ETFs, retail and institutional clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $41.5 billion were led by growth in Fixed Income, Factor, Core and European ETFs. Core and non-Core iShares ETFs saw net inflows of $18.3 billion and $23.2 billion, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $24.9 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $15.1 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $6.7 billion reflected net inflows of $5.5 billion in the United States and net inflows of $1.2 billion internationally. Retail inflows reflected strength in active fixed income, led by municipals, short duration and total return strategies, active equity and liquid alternatives funds, partially offset by outflows from multi-asset world allocation products.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $8.4 billion were led by fixed income net inflows of $18.5 billion, reflecting continued demand for liability-driven investment solutions, partially offset by equity index outflows of $9.9 billion, linked to client asset allocation, rebalancing and liquidity needs.
•
Institutional active net outflows of $4.4 billion were driven by active fixed income outflows of $12.1 billion, primarily due to several client-specific redemptions, partially offset by net inflows into active equity, alternatives and multi-asset strategies.
Cash management AUM increased to $511 billion, driven by net inflows of $32 billion.
AUM decreased $53.4 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro and British pound.

(1) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(2) Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing ten months.
(3) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.
(4) Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM increased $988.1 billion to $6.96 trillion at September 30, 2019, driven by net market appreciation and positive net inflows, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market appreciation of $735.5 billion was driven by higher US markets and fixed income appreciation.
Long-term net inflows of $236.6 billion included $120.5 billion, $108.3 billion and $7.8 billion from institutional clients, iShares ETFs and retail clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $108.3 billion were led by fixed income ETFs, which generated $87.4 billion of net inflows, across treasuries, investment grade corporate bond, high yield and emerging markets debt ETFs. iShares ETFs reflected $57.5 billion and $50.8 billion of net inflows into Core and non-Core ETFs, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $68.9 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $38.3 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $84.1 billion were primarily driven by active fixed income, multi-asset and alternative net inflows of $60.2 billion, $13.6 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively. Active fixed income net inflows included strong flows from two significant strategic client mandates and active multi-asset net inflows reflected continued growth in LifePath® target-date funds. Alternatives net inflows were led by flows into illiquid alternatives, including infrastructure, real estate and the first close of Long Term Private Capital (“LTPC”), a perpetual, direct private equity fund.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $36.4 billion were primarily driven by fixed income net inflows of $61.5 billion, led by continued demand for liability-driven investment solutions, partially offset by equity net outflows of $24.6 billion, linked to client asset allocation, rebalancing and liquidity needs.
•
Retail net inflows of $7.8 billion reflected net inflows of $15.3 billion in the United States, partially offset by net outflows of $7.5 billion internationally. Retail net inflows reflected strength in municipal fixed income funds.
Cash management AUM increased to $511 billion, primarily due to net inflows of $63.3 billion.
AUM decreased $47.2 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro and British pound.

AUM increased $519.8 billion to $6.96 trillion at September 30, 2019, driven by net inflows and net market appreciation, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market appreciation of $243.0 billion was driven by fixed income appreciation and higher US equity markets.
Long-term net inflows of $280.2 billion were comprised of net inflows of $189.7 billion, $87.5 billion and $3.0 billion from iShares ETFs, institutional and retail clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $189.7 billion reflected $90.7 billion and $99.0 billion of net inflows into Core and non-Core ETFs, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $133.2 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $49.4 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs. Fixed income net inflows of $106.2 billion were led by flows into treasuries, investment grade corporate bond, high yield and core bond ETFs. Equity net inflows of $76.1 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $78.2 billion primarily reflected active fixed income, multi-asset and alternative net inflows of $46.8 billion, $19.2 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. Active fixed income net inflows included the previously mentioned significant strategic client mandates and active multi-asset net inflows reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds and asset allocation strategies. Alternatives net inflows were led by flows into illiquid alternatives, including infrastructure, real estate and LTPC.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $9.3 billion were primarily driven by fixed income net inflows of $67.0 billion, led by continued demand for liability-driven investment solutions, partially offset by equity net outflows of $57.5 billion, linked to client asset allocation, rebalancing and liquidity needs.
•
Retail net inflows of $3.0 billion reflected net inflows of $20.2 billion in the United States, partially offset by net outflows of $17.2 billion internationally. Retail net inflows reflected strength in municipal fixed income funds and continued growth in LifePath target-date, partially offset by net outflows from multi-asset asset allocation strategies.
Cash management AUM increased to $511 billion, primarily due to net inflows of $69.4 billion.
AUM decreased $72.8 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound and Euro, partially offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the Japanese yen.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2018
Revenue increased $116 million, or 3%, from the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily driven by higher base fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $2,980 million increased $97 million from $2,883 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily driven by organic growth, the positive impact of market beta and acquisitions, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements on average AUM and strategic price changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue of $150 million in the current quarter compared with $160 million in third quarter of 2018.
Investment advisory performance fees of $121 million decreased $30 million from $151 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenue from alternative and long-only equity products.
Technology services revenue of $259 million increased $59 million from $200 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and higher revenue from Aladdin.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018
Revenue decreased $202 million, or 2%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily driven by lower performance fees, base fees and advisory and other revenue, partially offset by higher technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $8,688 million decreased $86 million from $8,774 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily driven by lower securities lending revenue, the impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and strategic price changes to certain products, partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions and organic growth. Securities lending revenue of $448 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $50 million from $498 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting reduced European seasonal demand and lower cash spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $211 million decreased $101 million from $312 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenue from long-only equity products and liquid alternatives, partially offset by higher revenue from illiquid alternatives.
Technology services revenue of $700 million increased $118 million from $582 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and higher revenue from Aladdin.
Advisory and other revenue of $164 million decreased $48 million from $212 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily reflecting lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments, and lower earnings from equity method investments.

BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Balance Sheet
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as voting rights entities (“VREs”) and VIEs, (collectively, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2018 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 included $11 million and $59 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated VREs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended September 30, 2019).
Accounts receivable at September 30, 2019 increased $369 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher base fees, technology services and performance fee receivables. Investments were $2,117 million at September 30, 2019 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $1,594 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the eFront Transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and property and equipment) increased $1,240 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the recognition of the operating lease ROU assets related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and an increase in certain strategic investments, unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities) and other assets.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at September 30, 2019 decreased $488 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to 2018 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by 2019 incentive compensation accruals. Other liabilities increased $987 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the recognition of the operating lease liabilities related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), partially offset by contingent liability payments in connection with certain prior acquisitions. Net deferred income tax liabilities at September 30, 2019 increased $221 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with the eFront Transaction, stock-based compensation and investment income.
Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs
The Company’s investments and investments of consolidated VIEs (collectively, “Total Investments”) were $2,117 million and $2,898 million, respectively, at September 30, 2019. Total Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s Total Investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of Total Investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents Total Investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of Total Investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of Total Investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $2,011 million and primarily reflected $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the eFront Transaction, $572 million of investment purchases and $160 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $151 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $2,378 million, primarily resulting from $1.9 billion of share repurchases, including $400 million in open market transactions, a $1.3 billion private transaction and $238 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $1.6 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $992 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows:

(2)
The Company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities.
(3)
Amount does not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals, which are paid in the first quarter.
Total liquidity resources decreased $1,778 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2018 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.9 billion, reflecting the impact of a $1.3 billion private transaction, approximately $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the eFront Transaction, and cash dividend payments of $1.6 billion, partially offset by $992 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings and cash flows from other operating activities.
A significant portion of the Company’s $3,736 million of Total Investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. In January 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for a total up to approximately 9.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 4.0 million common shares under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.7 billion, including a $1.3 billion private transaction that closed on March 25, 2019. The Company has completed its targeted level of share repurchases for the year, but will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise. At September 30, 2019, there were 5.9 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.8 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in March 2019 to extend the maturity date to March 2024 (the “2019 credit facility”). The 2019 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2019 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2019 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at September 30, 2019. The 2019 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At September 30, 2019, the Company had no amount outstanding under the credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2019 credit facility. At September 30, 2019, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At September 30, 2019, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $6.0 billion. See Note 13, Borrowings, in the 2018 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company paid approximately $121 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at September 30, 2019 were as follows:

The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of September 30, 2019.
In April 2019, the Company issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on April 30, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). Interest is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing October 30, 2019, and is approximately $33 million per year. The 2029 Notes may be redeemed prior to January 30, 2029 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at par thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2029 Notes.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At September 30, 2019, the Company had $533 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated VIEs. These funds include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at September 30, 2019 totaled $167 million and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments, or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At September 30, 2019, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $211 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $225 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at September 30, 2019. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at September 30, 2019.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, including information regarding the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2018 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. See Note 6, Consolidated Voting Rights Entities, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 7, Variable Interest Entities, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Leases. The Company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. The identification of whether a contract contains a lease requires judgment, including determining whether there are identified assets in the contract and whether the Company has control over such identified assets.
Fixed lease payments are included in ROU assets and lease liabilities on the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”). Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s IBR, including assessing the Company’s credit rating using various financial metrics, including revenue, operating margin and revenue growth, and, as appropriate, performing market analysis of yields on publicly traded bonds (secured or unsecured) of comparable companies. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on leases.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are
highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these funds. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments/investments of consolidated VIEs or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had $388 million and $293 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 15, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

RECONCILIATION OF U.S. GAAP OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN TO OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN, AS ADJUSTED See note (1) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on page 16 for more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP. RECONCILIATION OF U.S. GAAP NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO BLACKROCK TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO BLACKROCK, AS ADJUSTED See notes (2) and (3) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on page 17 for more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (unaudited) BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows: (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers. • Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. In 2018, a restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. In addition, in 2018, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. • Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. • Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries. (2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and restructuring charge. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments related to the restructuring charge and PNC LTIP funding obligation were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustment. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. (3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. forward-looking statements This filing, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRock’s future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations.

Overview

(together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $7.43 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2019. With approximately 16,200 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.
Our diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), separate accounts, collective investment trusts and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin®, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix and FutureAdvisor, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients. The Company is highly regulated and manages its clients’ assets as a fiduciary. We do not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients.
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors.
BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management and technology service relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through third-party distribution relationships, including financial professionals and pension consultants.
BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over two-thirds of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors. At December 31, 2019, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) held 22.0% of BlackRock’s voting common stock and 22.4% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which includes outstanding common and nonvoting preferred stock.
Management seeks to deliver value for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on BlackRock’s differentiated competitive position, including:
•
the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for index products;
•
the Company’s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 50% of employees outside the United States serving clients locally and supporting local investment capabilities. Approximately 40% of total AUM is managed for clients domiciled outside the United States;
•
the Company’s breadth of investment strategies, including market-cap weighted index, factors, systematic active, traditional fundamental active, high conviction alpha and illiquid alternative product offerings, which enhance its ability to tailor single- and multi-asset investment solutions to address specific client needs;
•
the Company’s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and macro trends including the secular shift to index investing and ETFs, a focus on income and retirement, increasing demand for sustainable investment strategies and barbelling using index, active and illiquid alternatives products; and
•
the Company’s longstanding commitment to innovation, technology services and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock technology products and solutions, including Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix, and FutureAdvisor. This commitment is further extended by minority investments in distribution technologies including Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Envestnet.
BlackRock operates in a global marketplace impacted by changing market dynamics and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.
The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in Aladdin and other technology products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives, in a manner consistent with their risk preferences, to deliver excellent client service and to innovate in technology to serve clients’ evolving needs. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures.
See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures”, for further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2019 and 2018.
In 2016, a restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. In 2015, compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact BlackRock’s book value.
(3)
Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items referred to above and exclude the effect on deferred income tax expense resulting from certain income tax matters. In 2017, $1.2 billion of net tax benefit related to The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted.

Results for 2017 and 2016 were recast to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Results for 2015 reflect accounting guidance prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

Percentage represents CAGR over a five-year period (2014-2019).
AUM represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.
Investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users or accomplishment of specific deliverables.
At December 31, 2019, total AUM was $7.43 trillion, representing a CAGR of 10% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including BKCA, Infraestructura Institucional and FutureAdvisor, which collectively added $2.2 billion of AUM in 2015, BofA Global Capital Management, which added $80.6 billion of AUM in 2016, the First Reserve Transaction, which added $3.3 billion of AUM in 2017 and the net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction, which added $27.5 billion of AUM in 2018. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.
The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:

Client Type
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, with a regionally focused business model. BlackRock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment, risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent.
Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors.
iShares ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as iShares ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, iShares ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in iShares ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections.
AUM by investment style and client type at December 31, 2019 is presented below.

Retail
BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the investment spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Technology solutions, digital distribution tools and a shift toward portfolio construction are increasing the number of financial advisors and end-retail clients using BlackRock products. Retail represented 10% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2019 and 31% of long-term base fees for 2019.
iShares ETFs have a significant retail component but is shown separately below. With the exclusion of iShares ETFs, retail AUM is predominantly comprised of active mutual funds. Mutual funds totaled $565.1 billion, or 80%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. 87% of retail long-term AUM is invested in active products.

•
US retail long-term net inflows of $23.4 billion were led by fixed income net inflows of $22.7 billion. Fixed income net inflows were diversified across exposures and products, with strong flows into municipal, total return, high yield and short duration bond offerings. Equity net inflows of $3.9 billion included the successful close of the $1.4 billion BlackRock Science & Technology Trust II, BlackRock’s largest closed-end fund launch in the last seven years. Alternatives net inflows of $2.7 billion were driven by flows into the BlackRock Global Event Driven fund. Multi-asset net outflows of $5.9 billion were primarily due to outflows from world allocation strategies.
•
International retail long-term net outflows of $7.6 billion resulted from net outflows from equity, multi-asset and fixed income, partially offset by alternatives net inflows. Alternatives net inflows of $1.8 billion were driven by flows into the BlackRock Global Event Driven fund. Equity net outflows of $4.5 billion were primarily due to outflows from European equities, as political and market uncertainty contributed to a risk-off environment in the region. Multi-asset net outflows of $3.4 billion were primarily due to outflows from world allocation strategies.
iShares ETFs
iShares is the leading ETF provider in the world with $2.2 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2019 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 20191 with net inflows of $183.5 billion driving an organic growth rate of 11%. iShares fixed income net inflows of $112.4 billion were diversified across exposures and product lines, led by flows into Core, treasuries and mortgage-backed securities funds. iShares equity net inflows of $64.7 billion were driven by flows into Core funds and factor-based ETFs. iShares ETF multi-asset and alternative funds contributed a combined $6.4 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities funds. iShares ETFs represented 33% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2019 and 41% of long-term base fees for 2019.

Institutional active AUM ended 2019 at $1.3 trillion, reflecting $99.5 billion of net inflows, positive across all asset classes. Fixed income net inflows of $55.0 billion included two sizable client wins in the second quarter of 2019. Multi-asset strategies saw continued growth, with net inflows of $28.8 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the LifePath® target-date suite.
Alternatives net inflows of $13.8 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure, private equity and real estate. Excluding return of capital and investment of $5.1 billion, alternatives net inflows were $18.9 billion. In addition, 2019 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, and at year-end 2019 we had approximately $24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients.
In total, Institutional active represented 19% of long-term AUM and 19% of long-term base fees.
Institutional index AUM totaled $2.6 trillion at December 31, 2019, reflecting $36.9 billion of net inflows. Fixed income net inflows of $75.0 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions. Equity net outflows of $37.6 billion resulted from client de-risking, re-allocating, re-balancing and seeking liquidity in a more uncertain market environment. Institutional index represented 38% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2019 and accounted for 9% of long-term base fees for 2019.
BlackRock’s institutional franchise generated 5% long-term organic base fee growth in 2019 reflecting strength in higher-fee illiquid alternatives, multi-asset solutions and liability-driven investment strategies.
The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:
•
Pensions, Foundations and Endowments. BlackRock is among the world’s largest managers of pension plan assets with $2.6 trillion, or 67%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2019. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $16.7 billion of long-term net inflows for the year, driven by continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite. Defined contribution represented $1.1 trillion of total pension AUM, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $78.7 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.
•
Official Institutions. BlackRock managed $234.4 billion, or 6%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2019. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.
•
Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $380.0 billion, or 10%, of institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2019. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $605.0 billion, or 15%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Long-term product offerings include alpha-seeking active and index strategies. Our alpha-seeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and iShares ETFs.
Although many clients use both alpha-seeking active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.
Equity
Year-end 2019 equity AUM totaled $3.8 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $28.4 billion. Net inflows included $64.7 billion into iShares ETFs, driven by net inflows into Core funds and factor-based ETFs, partially offset by non-ETF index and active net outflows of $33.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.
BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international
equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate.
Fixed Income
Fixed income AUM ended 2019 at $2.3 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $263.6 billion. iShares ETFs net inflows of $112.3 billion were led by flows into Core, treasuries and mortgage-backed securities funds. Non-ETF index net inflows of $76.3 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions. Active net inflows of $75.0 billion included two sizable institutional client wins in the second quarter of 2019, in addition to strong flows in municipal, total return, high yield and short duration bond offerings.
Multi-Asset
BlackRock’s multi-asset team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.

FutureAdvisor amounts do not include AUM held in iShares ETFs.
Multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $28.1 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed $18.9 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2019, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings. Retail net outflows of $9.3 billion were primarily due to outflows from world allocation strategies.
The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:
•
Asset allocation and balanced products represented 33% of multi-asset AUM at year-end. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products in this category include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families.
•
Target date and target risk products grew 11% organically in 2019, with net inflows of $23.5 billion. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 84% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation overlay model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products.
•
Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer (“OCIO”). These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives. In 2019, BlackRock saw $9.4 billion of net inflows, or 12% organic growth, in fiduciary mandates.
•
FutureAdvisor is a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients’ investments. As consumers increasingly engage with technology to invest, BlackRock and FutureAdvisor are positioned to empower distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining FutureAdvisor’s technology-enabled advice with BlackRock’s multi-asset investment capabilities, proprietary technology and risk analytics. FutureAdvisor AUM does not include underlying iShares ETF investments.
Alternatives
BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into three main categories - 1) illiquid alternatives, 2) liquid alternatives, and 3) currency and commodities. Illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions, private equity, opportunistic and credit, real estate and infrastructure. Liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds).
In 2019, alternatives generated $24.8 billion of net inflows, or $30.8 billion excluding return of capital/investment of $6.0 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital/investment were private equity solutions, opportunistic and credit strategies, real estate and infrastructure. Net inflows were driven by infrastructure, direct hedge funds, real estate, and private equity and opportunistic strategies. At year-end, we had approximately $24 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying.
We believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. Our highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.

• Alternative Solutions represents highly customized portfolios of alternative investments. In 2019, alternative solutions portfolios had $0.3 billion of net inflows.
•
Private Equity and Opportunistic included $14.4 billion in private equity solutions, $11.1 billion in opportunistic and credit offerings, and $2.4 billion in Long Term Private Capital (“LTPC”). LTPC was launched in 2019, and is a perpetual, direct private equity fund designed to create value for the long-term, limit re-investment risk and operate with lower volatility than comparable vehicles. Net inflows of $5.9 billion into private equity and opportunistic strategies included $2.4 billion of net inflows into both LTPC and opportunistic and credit offerings, and $1.1 billion of net inflows into private equity solutions.
•
Real Assets, which includes infrastructure and real estate, totaled $43.5 billion, reflecting net inflows of $7.9 billion, led by infrastructure deployments.
Liquid Alternatives
The Company’s liquid alternatives products’ net inflows of $4.0 billion were due to net inflows of $4.3 billion from direct hedge funds, partially offset by $0.3 billion of net outflows from hedge fund solutions. Direct hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings.
Currency and Commodities
The Company’s currency and commodities products include a range of active and index products.
Currency and commodities products had $6.8 billion of net inflows, primarily driven by iShares ETFs. iShares ETFs commodities products represented $36.1 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.
Cash Management
Cash management AUM totaled $545.9 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting $93.1 billion of net inflows. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds, short term investment funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs, New Taiwan Dollars or British pounds. Strong growth in cash management reflects BlackRock’s success in leveraging scale for clients and delivering innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions.

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, which serves as the investment and risk management system for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via the Aladdin Risk offering, as well as investment accounting capabilities. Aladdin Provider is a tool used by BlackRock’s custodial partners, connecting them to the platform to add operational efficiency. BlackRock also offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities, FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients’ investments, and Cachematrix, a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform. In 2019, BlackRock completed the acquisition of eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider. eFront will continue to be offered on a standalone basis, and, in combination with Aladdin, will provide clients with an ability to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform.
Technology services revenue of $974 million was up 24% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and continued growth in Aladdin. Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue.
At year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in the digital distribution companies Scalable Capital and iCapital, Acorns, a micro-investing tool, and Envestnet, a leading independent provider of technology-enabled, web-based investment solutions and services to financial advisors. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue. BlackRock records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense).
Securities Lending
Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.
Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $290 billion, up from $267 billion at year-end 2018. On average, relative to 2018, intrinsic lending spreads were slightly lower, while average cash reinvestment rates remained roughly flat. However, continued asset gathering in lending products resulted in increased balances compared to 2018.
BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.
Risk & Quantitative Analysis
Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.
COMPETITION
BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.
Employees
At December 31, 2019, BlackRock had a total of approximately 16,200 employees, including approximately 8,600 located in offices outside the United States.
REGULATION
Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock.
The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.
GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM
BlackRock’s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) was signed into law in the United States. Dodd-Frank is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions, many of which have been adopted. BlackRock has implemented a conformance program to address certain regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank, as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) investment company modernization initiatives. The cost of these conformance activities has been substantially absorbed by BlackRock; however, as certain limited aspects of Dodd-Frank and other rules are still being adopted, it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that any implementation of these rules and regulations will have upon BlackRock’s business, financial condition, and operating activities.
Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) Review
The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. In December 2019, the FSOC re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. This reduces the risk of entity-level designation, however the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI under Dodd-Frank, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “Federal Reserve”).
Taxation
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, legislation has been proposed in the House and Senate to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the European Union (“EU”), certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
The SEC, Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.
In November 2019, the SEC proposed a rule designed to enhance the regulation of the use of derivatives by registered investment companies, including mutual funds (other than money market funds), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. The proposed rule would permit such funds to use derivatives, such as forwards, futures, swaps and written options, that create future payment obligations, provided that the funds comply with certain conditions including adopting a derivatives risk management program and complying with a limit on the amount of leverage-related risk that a fund may obtain, based on value-at-risk. If adopted without change, the proposed rule would increase BlackRock’s disclosure and compliance obligations and may impact certain funds’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy.
Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements.
In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to Dodd-Frank central clearing and electronic trading venue execution requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. On March 1, 2017, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, became subject to requirements in the US, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks.
Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds
As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of ETFs in the markets, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other sponsors of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company’s business.
In addition, in September 2019, the SEC adopted rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) known as the “ETF Rule”. The ETF Rule will allow ETFs that satisfy certain conditions to operate without first obtaining individual exemptive relief from the SEC. The ETF Rule is designed to create a clear and consistent regulatory framework for most ETFs operating today and will impact all BlackRock ETFs registered under the Investment Company Act (including iShares ETFs). The ETF Rule and related form amendments became effective in December 2019. The form amendments will have a transition period of one year following the effective date. In addition, the ETF Rule rescinds, one year after its effective date, the existing exemptive relief for all eligible ETFs (including iShares ETFs).
Volcker Rule
Provisions of Dodd-Frank referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “Bank Holding Company Act”) that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve has taken the position that PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock, which is approximately 22%, in combination with certain other factors, causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule. Conformance with the Volcker Rule may require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in its covered funds, which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions.
Standards of Conduct Rulemaking
In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and broker-dealer standards of conduct. The package includes new rules requiring registered advisers and registered broker-dealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers and two new interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). The rulemakings and interpretations could increase BlackRock’s disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain other services to its clients. The Department of Labor (“DoL”) has also indicated it intends to propose a standards of conduct rule in 2020.
SEC Guidance on Proxy Voting Responsibilities of Investment Advisors
In August 2019, the SEC published guidance to assist investment advisers with their proxy voting responsibilities under the Advisers Act. The guidance confirmed that investment advisers’ fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to their clients apply to proxy voting and encouraged advisors with voting authority to review their policies and procedures in detail and consider whether more analysis may be required under certain circumstances, including when a proxy advisory firm’s services are retained. This guidance could impact voting arrangements between BlackRock and its clients, and lead to additional compliance, operational and disclosure obligations for BlackRock.
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers
In 2015, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Proposed Rule”) that would extend to a number of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Advisers Act, the requirement to establish written risk-based anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”). The Proposed Rule would include investment advisers within the Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of “financial institutions”, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements. If adopted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs.
Securities and Exchange Commission Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers
BlackRock’s business may also be impacted by SEC regulatory initiatives. The SEC and its staff are engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. The SEC has adopted rules that include (i) new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain US registered funds; (ii) enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers; and (iii) implementing liquidity risk management programs for ETFs and open-end funds, other than money market funds. These rules increase, and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the SEC's efforts may increase, BlackRock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock’s growth.
US Executive Order
On February 3, 2017, an executive order (the “Executive Order”) was issued articulating certain core principles for regulating the US financial system and directing the Secretary of the US Treasury to report on the extent to which existing laws, treaties, rules, regulations and policies promote, support or inhibit the federal regulation of the US financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles. Treasury has issued four reports in response to the Executive Order (the “Treasury Reports”), which include a number of recommendations, the majority of which require further legislative or regulatory action in order to be implemented, that may affect BlackRock’s business or operations. BlackRock will continue to monitor the potential impact of the Executive Order, as well as the Treasury Reports and any consequential legislative or regulatory action, on its business.
British Exit from the EU
Following the June 2016 vote to exit the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, the United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU on January 31, 2020 and entered an eleven-month transition period during which the UK, and UK-based entities, will retain the rights and obligations of EU membership.
Substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the UK and EU, but the UK government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the EU before the end of the transition period rather than continuing Single Market or Customs Union membership. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including there being no agreement in place when the transition period expires. These steps, many of which are time consuming and costly, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications, and are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations during the transition period and post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Reform of Investment Markets
BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company’s provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The Regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms, which came into force in January 2018, are substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. New disclosure and reporting obligations have been introduced, together with restrictions on how research may be funded and the nature of payments that may be provided to distributors. MiFID II, together with other market structure reforms, force more derivatives to be traded on-exchange, introduce new commodity derivatives position limits and significantly enhance reporting obligations associated with individual trades. The broad nature of the MiFID II reforms impact BlackRock’s product development, client servicing and distribution models. In particular, additional disclosures are required to be made in respect of costs and fees BlackRock charges to certain of its clients. MiFID II also impacts the ability of certain of BlackRock’s distribution partners to accept commissions from BlackRock for distributing BlackRock funds. Similar reforms have been introduced in Switzerland and Australia.
EU Market Access
The European Commission and certain EU Member States have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for a third country (i.e. non-EU country) to obtain “equivalence,” which is the process by which the legal, regulatory, and/or supervisory system in non-EU Member States is recognised by the European Commission as comparably effective to that in the EU, thereby allowing firms established in such non-EU Member States a degree of access to the EU single market in financial services. In addition, in 2019, the European Commission commenced a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive to assess, among other things, the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes. To the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and EU market access rights for asset management firms with non-EU operations, BlackRock’s ability to access EU-based clients may be adversely affected.
Cessation of LIBOR
The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates the administrator of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) has announced that it will no longer compel panel banks to submit rates for LIBOR after year-end 2021. As a result, sterling LIBOR and certain other indices which are utilized as benchmarks may no longer be published. The disappearance, or change in the manner of administration, of these benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for any BlackRock investments in instruments and securities linked to such benchmarks. BlackRock may also face operational challenges adopting successor benchmarks.
Revised EU Capital Requirements for Investment Firms
In December 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms. The proposal passed the EU legislative process and the final texts of the Regulation and Directive were published in December 2019. The new legislative package, which comes into effect in 2021, will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital BlackRock is required to hold in the EU and how such capital is calculated, as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms.
UK Asset Management Market Study
The FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer “value” to investors. Beginning in 2020, BlackRock will be required annually to disclose the conclusions of its assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If “value” has not been provided to consumers, BlackRock will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA’s final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and the UK regulatory regime will be revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA’s remedies could have a significant impact on BlackRock’s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.
Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers
Certain European policymakers continue to raise concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector. These concerns may lead to macroprudential policy measures being applied to open-ended investment funds broadly, or regulation being introduced that requires changes to the structural features of certain open-ended investment funds. Either eventuality could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.

In the UK, the FCA extended the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”) to all financial services firms in December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.
EU Shareholder Rights Directive
The European Commission has revised the Shareholder Rights Directive to enhance engagement between companies and their long-term shareholders. The revisions, which became effective in June 2019, require investment managers to provide EU institutional investors with enhanced disclosures on shareholder engagement and voting, and information on how the manager’s investment strategy contributes to such investors’ medium to long-term performance.
EU Sustainability Regulation
In 2018, the European Commission introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investments products, and issuers; and require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors. Rules arising from the reform proposals will come into effect beginning in 2021.
EXISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DoL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies.
Certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through Attorneys General, Insurance Commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities.
The Investment Company Act imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, was required to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) as a result of SEC rules giving effect to a section of Dodd-Frank requiring such registration. The rules subject BTC to new and additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.
BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA.
BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”) with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of Dodd-Frank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Two of BlackRock’s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange and a member of the MSRB, subject to MSRB rules.
Certain of BlackRock’s business activity in California is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective in January 2020 and which provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA imposes new obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA may result in fines, enhanced regulatory scrutiny and/or reputational harm.
US Banking Regulation
One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC’s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders.
As described in “Item 1 - Business”, as of December 31, 2019 PNC owned approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which may subject BlackRock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC. The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve has taken the position that this ownership interest, in combination with certain other factors, causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule, that are
more restrictive than those the Company is subject to under other applicable laws, as well as the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve, which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any effort by BlackRock to contest a control determination by the Federal Reserve may be costly and complex, and may not result in a reversal of such determination.
Regulation of Securities Financing Transactions
In its 2014 Annual Report, FSOC identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions. In addition, in November 2015, the EU introduced a regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions and total return swaps (“SFTR”). The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. The regulation is being implemented in phases and more detailed rules and guidance, including in respect of reporting obligations, is in process. As these rules and guidance become clearer, BlackRock may be required to introduce further compliance measures, which will subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock’s securities financing transaction activities, including potential adjustments to its activities as agent lender for its clients.
Regulation of Money Market Funds
In October 2016, rules were implemented to reform the regulatory structure governing US money market funds to address perceived systemic risks of money market funds. The rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Retail money market funds continue operating with a constant net asset value per share. The rules additionally provide for tools for institutional and retail money market funds’ boards designed to address market shocks, including the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances.
EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.
Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.
Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.
European Regulation
The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It also prudentially regulates those UK subsidiaries’ branches established in other EU countries and is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branches of certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and theme-based reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.
In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established.
BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EU. MiFID II sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock European subsidiaries must also comply with the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms (the Capital Requirements Directive and Capital Requirements Regulation). These include requirements on capital, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which imposes obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of alternative investment funds that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations.
BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with
certain counterparties) and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts to a European Securities and Markets Authority registered or recognized derivatives trade repository.
The EU has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”). The latest initiative in this area, UCITS V, aligns the UCITS depositary regime, UCITS remuneration rules and regulators’ power to sanction for breaches of the UCITS Directive with the requirements of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. Compliance with the UCITS directive subjects BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements.
Most EU Member States and other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches. For example, in May 2018, the EU Data Protection Directive was replaced by a more extensive General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock’s collection, processing and retention of personal data and reporting of data breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.
Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region
In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (“FIEA”) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEA. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act.
In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws, and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services activities in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection.
The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector.
Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.

As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.
MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS
Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, could cause:
•
the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;
•
the withdrawal of funds from BlackRock’s products in favor of products offered by competitors;
•
the rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;
•
an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•
a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.
The occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock’s AUM and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s net income and operating cash flows.
In recent years, there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates, interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates. BlackRock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Similarly, due to the global nature of BlackRock’s operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Any failure by BlackRock to manage movements in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar or its exposure to interest rates may cause BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s base fees, net income and operating cash flows.
In addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees.
BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund’s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance.
Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The investment management industry is highly competitive and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, have altered the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to spend more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with products and services offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock’s competitive success. Aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform flexibility or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, to the extent that Aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than BlackRock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, BlackRock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in Aladdin.
BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk.
BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. Conversely, the development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of products with a focus on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, requires continued innovative effort on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timescale they require. Any failure to develop new products and services, or successfully manage associated operational risks, could harm BlackRock’s reputation and expose the Company to additional costs, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.
At December 31, 2019, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $2.7 billion in its investments (see “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments”) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as other minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline.
BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.
BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2019 and subject to this type of indemnification was $210 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $226 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2019. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, as well as regulatory restrictions on the Company’s ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock’s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension, European fragmentation, unrest in the Middle East, Brexit negotiations and terrorist activity, as well as acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock’s control, including natural disasters, pandemics or health crises (such as the coronavirus), may arise from time to time. Any such events, and responses thereto, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company’s products, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Risks Related to INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE
Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:
•
client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors;
•
client shifts to products that charge lower fees;
•
the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;
•
reduced, minimal or no performance fees;
•
an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•
a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital.
Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.
A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $450 million, or 3%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company’s performance fee generating assets. In particular, as BlackRock takes on more advisory assignments for illiquid investments, performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products.
Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.
BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions, as well as any failure of BlackRock’s governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models or model assumptions, could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock’s business and reputation.
TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS
A failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock’s operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the Company’s reputation and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London, Budapest and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic, health crisis (such as the coronavirus) or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt BlackRock’s operations in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth.
In addition, despite BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.
A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack including a phishing scam, malware, or denial-of-service attack, or an internally caused incident, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, developments in BlackRock’s use of process automation, as well as the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock’s control. BlackRock’s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.
There have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information and the unauthorized transfer of customer funds, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors and terrorist organizations. BlackRock has been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and cause financial losses. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to strengthen its computer systems, processes, software, technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock’s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock’s systems.
In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.
Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
BlackRock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. In so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers. For example, Aladdin’s data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to Aladdin’s growth. In addition, the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin’s analytical calculations. Although BlackRock has implemented internal controls and procedures, and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the Aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. Any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with Aladdin’s size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise Aladdin’s resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients.
Continuing enhancements to Aladdin’s capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.
The operation of BlackRock’s Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. These updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose BlackRock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
In addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions.
Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.
BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.
Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses.
BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks.
Inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.
BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions. The success of BlackRock’s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock’s inorganic strategy may be heightened when acquired businesses are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products or business lines or are delivered via technology that differs from that employed by BlackRock. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions through due diligence, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry.
Client investments in real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.
BlackRock makes investments on behalf of its clients in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, that may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. These may include:
•
construction risks, including labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;
•
accidents, adverse weather, force majeure or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control;
•
personal injury or property damage;
•
failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;
•
exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;
•
environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;
•
changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;
•
the financial resources of tenants; and
•
contingent liabilities on disposition of assets.
The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock’s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management’s attention away from BlackRock’s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks.
As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Operating outside the United States (“US”) may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher compliance costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL
The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Many of BlackRock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock’s operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, or errors in judgment. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Although BlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, it cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks. BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which could cause adverse publicity, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company’s reputation and workplace culture, the immigration policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.
In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, if BlackRock’s share price were to decrease, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.
Risks Related to KEY THIRD-PARTY Relationships
The impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that BlackRock manages, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose BlackRock’s clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock maintains a robust vendor management program and regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackRock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple BlackRock clients. Any such operational issue, impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts that BlackRock manages for its clients, which may lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key vendors could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market data, market indices, technology and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients’ investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock’s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. While BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock’s arrangement with a
vendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.
BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex, and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company’s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock.
Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s Exchange-Traded Fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.
BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value. The net asset value of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF’s holdings. The trading price of the ETF’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. While an ETF’s creation/redemption feature and the arbitrage mechanism are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the ETF’s net asset value, exchange prices may deviate significantly from the ETF’s net asset value. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, inability or unwillingness of market markers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively, or significant market volatility. Although BlackRock and other large issuers of ETFs are working with market participants to seek to enhance US equity market resiliency, there can be no assurance that structural reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate significantly from an ETF’s net asset value, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world.
BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. In addition, many of BlackRock’s legal entities may be subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the UK Bribery Act, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations and the European Union (“EU”) and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which BlackRock operates. BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the General Data Protection Regulation, which expands data protection rules for individuals within the EU and for personal data exported outside the EU. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company’s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted.
BlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BlackRock’s bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see “Item 1 - Business - Regulation.”
Regulatory reforms in the United States expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
In recent years a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the United States, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. Further changes to financial services regulation may arise, including in connection with the executive order issued in February 2017 (the “Executive Order”) directing the US Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) to identify laws, treaties, regulations and other policies that promote or inhibit certain core principles for financial regulation, that may directly or indirectly impact BlackRock’s business or operating activities. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, or may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the United States, see “Item 1 - Business - Regulation,” key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:
•
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC and its staff are engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. The SEC has adopted rules that include (i) new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain US registered funds; (ii) enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers; and (iii) implementing liquidity risk management programs for ETFs and open-end funds, other than money market funds. These rules increase, and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the SEC's efforts may increase, BlackRock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock’s growth.
•
SEC ETF Rule: In September 2019, the SEC adopted rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) known as the “ETF Rule”. The ETF Rule will allow ETFs that satisfy certain conditions to operate without first obtaining individual exemptive relief from the SEC. The ETF Rule is designed to create a clear and consistent regulatory framework for most ETFs operating today and will impact all BlackRock ETFs registered under the Investment Company Act (including iShares ETFs). The ETF Rule and related form amendments became effective in December 2019. The form amendments will have a transition period of one year following the effective date. In addition, the ETF Rule rescinds, one year after its effective date, the existing exemptive relief for all eligible ETFs (including iShares ETFs).
•
Standards of Conduct Rulemaking: In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and broker-dealer standards of conduct. The package includes new rules requiring registered advisers and registered broker-dealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers, and two new interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). The rulemakings and interpretations could increase BlackRock’s disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain other services to its clients. The Department of Labor (“DoL”) has also indicated it intends to propose a standards of conduct rule in 2020.
•
SEC Derivatives Rule for US Registered Funds: In November 2019, the SEC proposed a rule designed to enhance the regulation of the use of derivatives by registered investment companies, including mutual funds (other than money market funds), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. The proposed rule would permit such funds to use derivatives, such as forwards, futures, swaps and written options, that create future payment obligations, provided that the funds comply with certain conditions including adopting a derivatives risk management program and complying with a limit on the amount of leverage-related risk that a fund may obtain, based on value-at-risk. If adopted without change, the proposed rule would increase BlackRock’s disclosure and compliance obligations and may impact certain funds’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy.
•
SEC Guidance on Proxy Voting Responsibilities of Investment Advisors: In August 2019, the SEC published guidance to assist investment advisers with their proxy voting responsibilities under the Advisers Act. The guidance confirmed that investment advisers’ fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to their clients apply to proxy voting and encouraged advisors with voting authority to review their policies and procedures in detail and consider whether more analysis may be required under certain circumstances, including when a proxy advisory firm’s services are retained. This guidance could impact voting arrangements between BlackRock and its clients, and lead to additional compliance, operational and disclosure obligations for BlackRock.
•
The Volcker Rule: Provisions of Dodd-Frank referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the Bank Holding Company Act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve has taken the position that PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock, which is approximately 22%, in combination with certain other factors, causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule. Conformance with the Volcker Rule may require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in its covered funds, which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions.
•
Designation as a systemically important financial institution (“SIFI”): The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. In December 2019, the FSOC re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. This reduces the risk of an entity-level designation, however the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI under Dodd-Frank, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.
Regulatory reforms in the United States could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be costly, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
BlackRock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the United States and the Company may be affected by a number of proposed or fully or partially implemented reform initiatives in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty, including:
•
British Exit from the EU: The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020 and entered an eleven-month transition period during which the UK, and UK-based entities, will retain the rights and obligations of EU membership. Substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the UK and EU, but the UK government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the EU before the end of the transition period rather than continuing Single Market or Customs Union membership. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including there being no agreement in place when the transition period expires. These steps, many of which are time consuming and costly, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications, and are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations during the transition period and post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
•
Reform of investment markets: In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The Regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms, which came into force in January 2018, are substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. New disclosure and reporting obligations have been introduced, together with restrictions on how research may be funded and the nature of payments that may be provided to distributors. MiFID II, together with other market structure reforms, force more derivatives to be traded on-exchange, introduce new commodity derivatives position limits and significantly enhance reporting obligations associated with individual trades. The broad nature of the MiFID II reforms impact BlackRock’s product development, client servicing and distribution models. In particular, additional disclosures are required to be made in respect of costs and fees BlackRock charges to certain of its clients. MiFID II also impacts the ability of certain of BlackRock’s distribution partners to accept commissions from BlackRock for distributing BlackRock funds. Similar reforms have been introduced in Switzerland and Australia.
•
Revised EU capital requirements for investment firms: In December 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms. The proposal passed the EU legislative process and the final texts of the Regulation and Directive were published in December 2019. The new legislative package, which comes into effect in 2021, will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital BlackRock is required to hold in the EU and how such capital is calculated, as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms.
•
EU market access: In 2019, the European Commission commenced a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive to assess, among other things, the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes. To the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and EU market access rights for asset management firms with non-EU operations, BlackRock’s ability to access EU-based clients may be adversely affected.
•
Senior Managers and Certification Regime: In the UK, the FCA extended the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”) to all financial services firms in December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.
•
UK asset management market study: The FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer “value” to investors. Beginning in 2020, the Company will be required annually to disclose the conclusions of its assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If “value” has not been provided to consumers, the Company will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA’s final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and the UK regulatory regime will be revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA’s remedies could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.

EU Sustainability Regulation: In 2018, the European Commission introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investments products, and issuers; and require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors. Rules arising from the reform proposals will come into effect beginning in 2021.
•
Macroprudential policies for asset managers: Certain European policymakers continue to raise concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector. These concerns may lead to macroprudential policy measures being applied to open-ended investment funds broadly, or regulation being introduced that requires changes to the
structural features of certain open-ended investment funds. Either eventuality could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.
International regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s internationally-based clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), DoL, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US and non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock’s shareholders, which could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.
In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.
As BlackRock’s business continues to grow, the Company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. In addition, the SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts. BlackRock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the Company fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, or penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCC regulation and capital requirements. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations. In addition, as described in “Item 1 - Business-Regulation”, as of December 31, 2019, PNC owned approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which may subject BlackRock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC. The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve has taken the position that this ownership interest, in combination with certain other factors, causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule, that are more restrictive than those the Company is subject to under other applicable laws, as well as the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve, which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any effort by BlackRock to contest a control determination by the Federal Reserve may be costly and complex and may not result in a reversal of such determination.
Failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Of note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership.
As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as “common ownership”. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. Additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries managed by asset managers with higher consumer prices and executive compensation, among other things. In the US, the FTC over the course of late 2018 held hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century, one of which included a discussion of common ownership. The hearings may be the subject of a report in 2020. In the EU, the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is expected to publish a report on common ownership, and the European Commission may do so in 2020. There is substantial literature highlighting the
benefits of index investing, as well as casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments. Some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on stakes managed by asset managers that, if enacted into policy measures, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, increase transaction costs and limit the availability of products for investors. This may, in turn, adversely affect BlackRock.
New tax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities.
In the US, legislation has been proposed in the House and Senate to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
RISKS RELATED TO BLACKROCK’S SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER
PNC owns 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Future sales or distributions of BlackRock’s common stock in the public market by the Company or PNC could adversely affect the trading price of BlackRock’s common stock.
As of December 31, 2019, PNC owned 22% of the Company’s capital stock. Sales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of BlackRock’s common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales or distributions might occur, may cause the market price of BlackRock’s common stock to decline.
PNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC.
As discussed in BlackRock’s proxy statement, PNC has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board.
As discussed in BlackRock’s proxy statement, pursuant to BlackRock’s stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:
•
appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock;
•
any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than the persons holding such majority of the total voting power prior to the occurrence of any such merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock;
•
any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRock’s consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;
•
any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis;
•
except for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;
•
any amendment to BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or
•
any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.
Additionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC:
•
any sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenue of which, together with the annualized revenue of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenue of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;
•
for so long as BlackRock is deemed a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the Bank Holding Company Act;
•
any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC;
•
any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or
•
a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.",,,,,4526.0,,0.0,16:30:05,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

(4) Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs. SUMMARY OF REVENUE Highlights • Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue increased $250 million from the first quarter of 2019, primarily driven by organic growth, the net positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange on average AUM, despite the impact of recent market volatility, and the effect of one more day in the quarter, partially offset by strategic pricing changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue of $158 million increased from $148 million in the first quarter of 2019. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue decreased $34 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by the impact of lower average AUM related to recent market declines and the effect of one less day in the quarter, partially offset by the impact of organic growth. Securities lending revenue of $158 million decreased from $169 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. • Performance fees increased $15 million from the first quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from liquid alternative products. Performance fees decreased $198 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to a seasonally higher number of funds with a performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter of 2019. • Technology services revenue increased $70 million from the first quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and higher revenue from Aladdin®. • Advisory and other revenue decreased $41 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting lower advisory and transition management assignments. SUMMARY OF OPERATING EXPENSE Highlights • On , BlackRock announced the establishment of The BlackRock Foundation (the “Foundation”) and the contribution of its remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. to the Foundation and the BlackRock Charitable Fund, which BlackRock established in 2013 (the “Charitable Contribution”). The Charitable Contribution resulted in an operating expense of $589 million, which was offset by a $122 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain on the contributed shares and a tax benefit of $241 million. The Charitable Contribution will provide long-term funding for BlackRock’s philanthropic investments and partnerships. • Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $73 million from the first quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting higher base compensation partially linked to a higher headcount. Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $75 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation, driven by lower operating income and lower performance fees, partially offset by higher seasonal payroll taxes and higher base compensation. • Direct fund expense increased $35 million from the first quarter of 2019 and $32 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting higher average AUM. • General and administration expense increased $754 million from the first quarter of 2019, primarily driven by the Charitable Contribution and $84 million of product launch costs associated with the January 2020 close of the $2.3 billion BlackRock Health Sciences Trust II. The increase also reflected higher technology expense, including certain costs related to COVID-19, higher professional services expense, contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions, and costs related to certain legal matters, including Aviron Capital, LLC., partially offset by lower marketing and promotional expense. General and administration expense increased $627 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely driven by the Charitable Contribution, $84 million of product launch costs and costs related to certain legal matters, including Aviron Capital, LLC., partially offset by seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments and lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense. INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) Highlights • First quarter 2020 income tax benefit included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. • First quarter 2020 and 2019 income tax expense (benefit) included $64 million and $23 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. • Fourth quarter 2019 income tax expense included $21 million of discrete tax benefits. SUMMARY OF NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), LESS NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. For more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP see note (2) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on pages 14-17. (2) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions. (3) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to equity and fixed income investments. (4) The amount for the three months ended  includes a nonoperating pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital Network, Inc. Additional amounts primarily include noncash pre-tax gains (losses) related to the revaluation of a corporate minority investment. RECONCILIATION OF US GAAP OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN TO OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN, AS ADJUSTED See note (1) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on pages 16 and 17 for more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP. RECONCILIATION OF US GAAP NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) TO NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), LESS NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NCI, AS ADJUSTED See note (2) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on page 17 for more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP. RECONCILIATION OF US GAAP NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO BLACKROCK TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO BLACKROCK, AS ADJUSTED See notes (3) and (4) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on page 17 for more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (unaudited) BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows: (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers. • Operating income, as adjusted, includes a non-GAAP expense adjustment. The Charitable Contribution expense of $589 million has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature. • Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. • Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries. (2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. The noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $122 million related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature. (3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. The first quarter of 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the non-recurring nature of the Charitable Contribution. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. (4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. forward-looking statements This filing, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRock’s future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations.

(“PNC”); (14) changes in law and policy and uncertainty pending any such changes; (15) terrorist activities, international hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries or BlackRock; (16) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (17) fluctuations in the carrying value of BlackRock’s economic investments; (18) the impact of changes to tax legislation, including income, payroll and transaction taxes, and taxation on products or transactions, which could affect the value proposition to clients and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (19) BlackRock’s success in negotiating distribution arrangements and maintaining distribution channels for its products; (20) the failure by a key vendor of BlackRock to fulfill its obligations to the Company; (21) any disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds (“ETF”) platform; (22) the impact of BlackRock electing to provide support to its products from time to time and any potential liabilities related to securities lending or other indemnification obligations; and (23) the impact of problems at other financial institutions or the failure or negative performance of products at other financial institutions. BlackRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and BlackRock’s subsequent filings with the SEC, accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on BlackRock’s website at www.blackrock.com, discuss these factors in more detail and identify additional factors that can affect forward-looking statements.

COVID-19 Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures are, among other things, severely restricting global economic activity, which is disrupting supply chains, lowering asset valuations, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, decreasing liquidity in markets for certain securities and causing significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact our business, the effects of which are ongoing, and such impact is expected to continue in future quarters if conditions persist. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on our business, including our operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced assets under management, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of our investment portfolio, including our co-investments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and our ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;
•
the negative impact of the pandemic on our clients and key vendors, market participants and other third-parties with whom we do business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin and/or our other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity risks; and
•
the disruption to our workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations on our remote work environment, and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on our products, clients, vendors and employees. BlackRock continues to service clients amid uncertainty and disruption linked to COVID-19 and is actively managing its business to respond to the impact.
United Kingdom Exit from European Union
Following the June 2016 vote to exit the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as Brexit, the United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU on January 31, 2020 and entered an eleven-month transition period during which the UK, and UK-based entities, will retain the rights and obligations of EU membership.
Substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the UK and the EU, but the UK government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the EU before the end of the transition period rather than continuing Single Market or Customs Union membership. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including the potential failure of the UK and the EU to negotiate an agreement before the transition period expires. These steps, many of which are time consuming and costly, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications, and are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations during the transition period and post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Other Development
On February 13, 2020, BlackRock announced the establishment of The BlackRock Foundation (the “Foundation”) and the contribution of its remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. to the Foundation and the BlackRock Charitable Fund, which BlackRock established in 2013 (together, the “Charitable Contribution”). The Charitable Contribution resulted in an operating expense of $589 million, which was offset by a $122 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain on the contributed shares and a tax benefit of $241 million in the condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Charitable Contribution will provide long-term funding for BlackRock’s philanthropic investments and partnerships. The general and administration expense, nonoperating gain and associated tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution have been excluded from as adjusted results.

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019
GAAP. Operating income of $684 million and operating margin of 18.4% decreased $549 million and 1,840 bps, respectively, from the first quarter of 2019. Operating income and operating margin reflected higher base fees and technology services revenue, which were more than offset by higher expense, primarily due to the impact of $589 million related to the Charitable Contribution and $84 million of product launch costs associated with the January 2020 close of the $2.3 billion BlackRock Health Sciences Trust II.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) decreased $10 million from the first quarter of 2019, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on un-hedged seed capital investments and a corporate minority investment, partially offset by the impact of a pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital Network, Inc. (“iCapital”). Non-operating results also reflected the $122 million pre-tax gain related to the Charitable Contribution.
Income tax benefit (expense) for the first quarter of 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. First quarter 2020 and 2019 income tax expense (benefit) included $64 million and $23 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $1.46, or 22%, from the first quarter of 2019, reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution and product launch costs, partially offset by higher revenue, a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,273 million increased $40 million from the first quarter of 2019. Earnings per diluted common share were essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2019 as higher operating income, a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter, were more than offset by lower nonoperating income versus a year ago. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from as adjusted results.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP“).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, includes a non-GAAP expense adjustment. The Charitable Contribution expense of $589 million has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the
Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. The noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $122 million related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, for information on the Charitable Contribution.
The three months ended March 31, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the non-recurring nature of the Charitable Contribution.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
(4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM decreased $963.0 billion to $6.47 trillion at March 31, 2020, driven by net market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by positive net inflows.
Net market depreciation of $906.5 billion was driven by declines in global equity markets.
Long-term net outflows of $18.7 billion included $31.0 billion and $1.5 billion of net outflows from institutional and retail clients, respectively, partially offset by net inflows of $13.8 billion into iShares ETFs. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $29.1 billion were primarily driven by equity net outflows of $17.4 billion and fixed income net outflows of $11.4 billion, reflecting the impact of recent market-related de-risking and client liquidity needs.
•
Institutional active net outflows of $1.9 billion were driven by active fixed income net outflows of $13.9 billion, partially offset by net inflows of $8.2 billion and $2.8 billion into active multi-asset and alternatives strategies, respectively.
•
Retail net outflows of $1.5 billion primarily reflected net outflows from active fixed income and multi-asset world allocation products, partially offset by strength in active equity and alternatives net inflows.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $13.8 billion were led by growth in sustainable investments, factor strategies and core equity ETFs. Core and non-Core iShares ETFs saw net inflows of $7.0 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were led by $9.9 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs.
Cash management AUM increased to $594.1 billion, driven by net inflows of $52.4 billion, primarily in US government funds.
AUM decreased $91.4 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar.

Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.

Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM decreased $48.7 billion to $6.47 trillion at March 31, 2020, driven by net market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by positive net inflows.
Net market depreciation of $381.7 billion was driven by declines in global equity markets.
Long-term net inflows of $258.0 billion were comprised of net inflows of $166.6 billion, $76.3 billion and $15.1 billion from iShares ETFs, institutional and retail clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $166.6 billion reflected $72.0 billion and $94.6 billion of net inflows into Core and non-Core ETFs, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $111.0 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $44.3 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs. Fixed income net inflows of $78.5 billion were led by flows into treasuries, investment grade corporate bonds, high yield and core bond ETFs. Equity net inflows of $76.8 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $82.2 billion reflected active multi-asset, fixed income, alternative and equity net inflows of $34.4 billion, $28.1 billion, $11.3 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. Active multi-asset net inflows reflected continued growth in LifePath® target-date funds and asset allocation strategies. Active fixed income net inflows reflected two significant strategic client mandates in the second quarter of 2019. Alternatives net inflows were led by flows into illiquid alternatives, including infrastructure, opportunistic funds and Long Term Private Capital, a perpetual, direct private equity fund.
•
Retail net inflows of $15.1 billion reflected net inflows of $16.6 billion and $1.1 billion in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by net outflows of $2.6 billion in Asia-Pacific. Retail net inflows reflected strength in municipal fixed income, US equity and sector equity funds, and liquid alternative funds, partially offset by net outflows from multi-asset world allocation strategies.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $5.9 billion were primarily driven by equity net outflows of $39.7 billion, driven by client de-risking, reallocating, rebalancing and liquidity needs in a more uncertain market environment, partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $34.8 billion, driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions.
Cash management AUM increased to $594 billion, due to net inflows of $139.8 billion, primarily in government funds.
AUM decreased $66.1 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound and the Euro.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2019
Revenue increased $364 million, or 11%, from the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily driven by higher base fees and 34% growth in technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3,055 million increased $250 million from $2,805 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily driven by organic growth, the net positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange on average AUM, despite the impact of recent market volatility, and the effect of one more day in the quarter, partially offset by strategic pricing changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue of $158 million increased from $148 million in first quarter of 2019.
Investment advisory performance fees of $41 million increased $15 million from $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from liquid alternative products.
Technology services revenue of $274 million increased $70 million from $204 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and higher revenue from Aladdin.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2019
GAAP. Expense increased $913 million from the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily driven by higher general and administration expense, including the impact of the Charitable Contribution and product launch costs in the current quarter, higher employee compensation and benefits expense, and higher volume-related expense.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $73 million from the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily reflecting higher base compensation partially linked to a higher headcount.
Direct fund expense increased $35 million from the three months ended March 31, 2019, reflecting higher average AUM.
General and administration expense increased $754 million from the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily driven by the Charitable Contribution and $84 million of product launch costs. The increase also reflected higher technology expense, including certain costs related to COVID-19, higher professional services expense, contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions, and costs related to certain legal matters, including Aviron Capital, LLC., partially offset by lower marketing and promotional expense.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as VIEs and voting rights entities (“VREs”), (collectively, “consolidated sponsored investment products”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2019 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment products to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 included $316 million and $141 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment products (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended March 31, 2020).
Accounts receivable at March 31, 2020 decreased $84 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower receivables from base fees, partially offset by higher technology services receivables. Investments, including the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products were $5,240 million at March 31, 2020 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $28 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and property and equipment) increased $1,453 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a net decrease in certain corporate minority investments, primarily related to the previously discussed Charitable Contribution of the remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at March 31, 2020 decreased $1,199 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to 2019 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by 2020 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at March 31, 2020 decreased $185 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower current income taxes payables. Other liabilities increased $1,618 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets). Net deferred income tax liabilities at March 31, 2020 decreased $124 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with investment income and the income tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution, partially offset by the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $5,240 million and $5,489 million at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the consolidated sponsored investment products. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were $19 million and reflected $52 million of purchases of property and equipment and $28 million of net investment purchases, partially offset by $61 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were $256 million, primarily resulting from $657 million of share repurchases, including $400 million in open market transactions and $257 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $596 million of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $999 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were as follows:

Amounts do not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals, which are paid in the first quarter.
Total liquidity resources decreased $598 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2019 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $657 million and cash dividend payments of $596 million, partially offset by $999 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings and cash flows from other operating activities.
A significant portion of the Company’s $3,798 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
The Company continues to monitor its liquidity and capital resources due to the current pandemic. The Company’s liquidity and capital resources were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions during the first quarter of 2020.
Share Repurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 0.8 million common shares in open market transactions under the share repurchase program for approximately $400 million. At March 31, 2020, there were 5.1 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2020 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in March 2020 to extend the maturity date to March 2025 (the “2020 credit facility”). The 2020 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2020 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2020 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at March 31, 2020. The 2020 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At March 31, 2020, the Company had no amount outstanding under the credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2020 credit facility. At March 31, 2020, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At March 31, 2020, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $6.0 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2019 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company paid approximately $29 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at March 31, 2020 were as follows:

__________________________
(1)
The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of March 31, 2020.
In January 2020, the Company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.40% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on April 30, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2030 Notes were used for general corporate purposes. Interest of approximately $24 million per year is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing on April 30, 2020. The 2030 Notes may be redeemed prior to January 30, 2030 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2030 Notes.
In April 2020, the Company issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.90% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on January 28, 2031 (the “2031 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2031 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of all or a portion of the $750 million 4.25% Notes due May 2021. Interest of approximately $24 million per year will be payable semi-annually on January 28 and July 28 of each year, commencing July 28, 2020. The 2031 Notes may be redeemed prior to October 28, 2030 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2031 Notes thereafter. The discount and debt issuance costs will be amortized over the term of the 2031 Notes.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At March 31, 2020, the Company had $583 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated sponsored investment products. These products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at March 31, 2020 totaled $218 million and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of March 31, 2020 and subject to this type of indemnification was $224 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $238 billion were held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at March 31, 2020. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at March 31, 2020.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2019 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $535 million and $483 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 16, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.
Accounting Developments
For accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during the three months ended March 31, 2020, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in BlackRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, BlackRock’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and may adversely affect our business, including our operations and financial condition, and may cause our assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures are, among other things, severely restricting global economic activity, which is disrupting supply chains, lowering asset valuations, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, decreasing liquidity in markets for certain securities and causing significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact our business, the effects of which are ongoing, and such impact is expected to continue in future quarters if conditions persist. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on our business, including our operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of our investment portfolio, including our co-investments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and our ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on our clients and key vendors, market participants and other third-parties with whom we do business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin® and/or our other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity risks; and
•
the disruption to our workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations on our remote work environment, and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on our products, clients, vendors and employees. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the other risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",627.0,,0.0,12:02:08,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

On May 15, 2020, a subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) completed the secondary offering of 31,628,573 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $420 per share, which included 823,188 shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of the Company’s Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock and 2,875,325 shares of common stock under the fully exercised underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. Also on May 15, 2020, PNC completed the sale of 2,650,857 shares to the Company at a price of $414.96 per share. The shares repurchased by the Company were in addition to the share repurchase authorization under the Company’s existing share repurchase program. The secondary offering and the Company’s share repurchase resulted in PNC’s exit of its entire ownership position in the Company, other than 500,000 shares that PNC contributed to The PNC Foundation.
Certain prior period presentations and disclosures, while not required to be recast, were reclassified to ensure comparability with current period classifications.
COVID-19 Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in authorities implementing numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact our business. While global markets have recovered to varying degrees since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on our business, including our operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of our investment portfolio, including our coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and our ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on our clients and key vendors, market participants and other third-parties with whom we do business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin and/or our other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity risks; and
•
the disruption to our workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations on our remote work environment, and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on our products, clients, vendors and employees. BlackRock continues to service clients amid uncertainty and disruption linked to COVID-19 and is actively managing its business to respond to the impact.
United Kingdom Exit from European Union
Following the June 2016 vote to exit the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as Brexit, the United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU on January 31, 2020 and entered an eleven-month transition period during which the UK, and UK-based entities, will retain the rights and obligations of EU membership.
Substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the UK and the EU, but the UK government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the EU before the end of the transition period rather than continuing Single Market or Customs Union membership. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including the potential failure of the UK and the EU to negotiate an agreement before the transition period expires. These steps, many of which are time consuming and costly, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications, and are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations during the transition period and post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Other Development
On February 13, 2020, BlackRock announced the establishment of The BlackRock Foundation (the “Foundation”) and the contribution of its remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (“PennyMac”) to the Foundation and the BlackRock Charitable Fund, which BlackRock established in 2013 (together, the “Charitable Contribution”). The Charitable Contribution resulted in an operating expense of $589 million, which was offset by a $122 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain on the contributed shares and a tax benefit of $241 million in the condensed consolidated statement of income for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The Charitable Contribution provides long-term funding for BlackRock’s philanthropic investments and partnerships. The general and administration expense, nonoperating gain and associated tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution have been excluded from as adjusted results.

THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019
GAAP. Operating income of $1,406 million and operating margin of 38.5% increased $128 million and 220 bps, respectively, from the second quarter of 2019. Operating income and operating margin reflected higher base fees, driven by organic growth and higher securities lending revenue, higher performance fees and 17% growth in technology services revenue. The increase in operating income also reflected lower general and administration expense, including the impact of $59 million of product launch costs in the second quarter of 2019. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) increased $122 million from the second quarter of 2019, primarily driven by mark-to-market gains on un-hedged seed capital investments and revaluation of a corporate minority investment.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.44, or 22%, from the second quarter of 2019, driven primarily by higher operating and nonoperating income, a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating margin of 43.7% increased 60 bps from the second quarter of 2019.
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 COMPARED WITH SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019
GAAP. Operating income of $2,090 million decreased $421 million and operating margin of 28.4% decreased 820 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2019. Operating income and operating margin reflected higher base fees, technology services revenue and performance fees, which were more than offset by higher expense, primarily driven by the impact of $589 million related to the Charitable Contribution.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI increased $112 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019, driven by the impact of a pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital Network, Inc. (“iCapital”) and $122 million pre-tax gain related to the Charitable Contribution, partially offset by mark-to-market losses on un-hedged seed capital investments.
Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 included $66 million and $14 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of each year. Income tax benefit (expense) for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.03 from the six months ended June 30, 2019, reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution, partially offset by higher revenue, higher nonoperating income, a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count for the six months ended June 30, 2020.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $2,679 million increased $168 million and operating margin of 42.7% increased 20 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2019. Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.42, or 11%, from the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to higher operating income, a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from as adjusted results.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP“).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, included a non-GAAP expense adjustment during the six months ended June 30, 2020. The Charitable Contribution expense of $589 million has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the
Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $122 million related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, for information on the Charitable Contribution.
The six months ended June 30, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the non-recurring nature of the Charitable Contribution.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
(4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(2)
Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing four months.
(3)
Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Approximately $3.9 billion of iShares ETFs AUM held in advisory accounts associated with the FRBNY assignment as of June 30, 2020 (disclosed via FRBNY reporting as of July 10, 2020) are included within Fixed Income iShares ETFs AUM or Fixed Income AUM above. These holdings are excluded from Advisory AUM.
(4)
Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM increased $851.3 billion to $7.32 trillion at June 30, 2020, driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows and the positive impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market appreciation of $724.7 billion was driven by global equity and fixed income market appreciation.
Long-term net inflows of $62.2 billion included $51.0 billion and $16.2 billion net inflows into iShares ETFs and retail, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $5.0 billion from institutional clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $51.0 billion reflected continued growth in fixed income and sustainable ETFs, partially offset by net outflows from international equity exposures, linked to portfolio tactical allocation needs. Core and non-Core iShares ETFs saw net inflows of $1.3 billion and $49.7 billion, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $28.5 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $21.2 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $16.2 billion primarily reflected strength in high yield bond, active equity and event-driven liquid alternatives funds.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $2.5 billion were driven by fixed income, LifePath@ target-date funds, OCIO, systematic active equity and illiquid alternatives strategies, partially offset by net outflows from world allocation strategies.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $7.5 billion were primarily driven by fixed income net outflows of $10.7 billion, reflecting re-balancing into equity, or de-risking and client liquidity needs, partially offset by net inflows of $3.0 billion into equity strategies.
Cash management AUM increased to $619.4 billion, driven by net inflows of $24.2 billion.
AUM increased $26.4 billion due to the positive impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the Euro.

Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Approximately $3.9 billion of iShares ETFs AUM held in advisory accounts associated with the FRBNY assignment as of June 30, 2020 (disclosed via FRBNY reporting as of July 10, 2020) are included within Fixed Income iShares ETFs AUM or Fixed Income AUM above.

Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM decreased $111.7 billion to $7.32 trillion at June 30, 2020, driven by net market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by positive net inflows.
Net market depreciation of $181.9 billion was primarily driven by the impact of first quarter global equity market declines, partially offset by fixed income market appreciation.
Long-term net inflows of $43.5 billion primarily included $64.8 billion and $14.7 billion of net inflows into iShares ETFs and retail, respectively, partially offset by net outflows $36.6 billion from institutional index clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $64.8 billion were led by growth in fixed income and sustainable ETFs. Core and non-Core iShares ETFs saw net inflows of $8.3 billion and $56.5 billion, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $38.4 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $20.6 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $14.7 billion primarily reflected net inflows from active equity and alternative products, partially offset by net outflows from multi-asset world allocation strategies.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $36.6 billion were primarily driven by fixed income net outflows of $22.1 billion and equity net outflows of $14.4 billion, reflecting the impact of recent market-related de-risking and client liquidity needs.
Cash management AUM increased to $619.4 billion, driven by net inflows of $76.6 billion.
AUM decreased $65.0 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound.

Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(2)
Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
(3)
Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Approximately $3.9 billion of iShares ETFs AUM held in advisory accounts associated with the FRBNY assignment as of June 30, 2020 (disclosed via FRBNY reporting as of July 10, 2020) are included within Fixed Income iShares ETFs AUM or Fixed Income AUM above. These holdings are excluded from Advisory AUM.
(4)
Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM increased $475.5 billion to $7.32 trillion at June 30, 2020, driven by positive net inflows and net market appreciation, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market appreciation of $167.4 billion was primarily driven by fixed income market appreciation.
Long-term net inflows of $194.8 billion were comprised of net inflows of $181.5 billion, $29.4 billion and $11.5 billion into iShares ETFs, retail and institutional active products, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $27.6 billion from institutional index products. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $181.5 billion reflected $53.6 billion and $127.9 billion of net inflows into Core and non-Core ETFs, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $112.3 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $56.9 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs. Fixed income net inflows of $104.3 billion were led by flows into investment grade corporate bonds, treasuries, high yield and core bond ETFs. Equity net inflows of $58.4 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures.
•
Retail net inflows of $29.4 billion primarily reflected net inflows of $19.0 billion and $11.0 billion in Americas and EMEA, respectively. Retail net inflows reflected strength in global equity and sector equity funds, high yield and municipal fixed income funds, and alternative funds.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $11.5 billion primarily reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, illiquid alternatives and systematic active equity, partially offset by active fixed income net outflows.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $27.6 billion were primarily driven by equity net outflows of $37.3 billion, driven by recent client de-risking, reallocating, rebalancing and liquidity needs in a more uncertain market environment, partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $9.9 billion, driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions.
Cash management AUM increased to $619.4 billion, due to net inflows of $138.4 billion.
AUM decreased $40.2 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound and the Euro.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2019
Revenue increased $124 million, or 4%, from the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by organic growth, higher securities lending revenue and performance fees, and 17% growth in technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $2,966 million increased $63 million from $2,903 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by organic growth and higher securities lending revenue, partially offset by the negative impact of equity beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, and strategic pricing changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue of $210 million in the current quarter increased $60 million from $150 million in second quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting higher asset spreads and average balances of securities on loan.
Investment advisory performance fees of $112 million increased $48 million from $64 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from alternative and long-only equity products.
Technology services revenue of $278 million increased $41 million from $237 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin.
Advisory and other revenue of $39 million decreased $14 million from $53 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting the impact of the previously discussed Charitable Contribution of the remaining 20% stake in PennyMac in the first quarter of 2020.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2019
Revenue increased $488 million, or 7%, from the six months ended June 30, 2019, reflecting higher base and performance fees and higher technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $6,021 million increased $313 million from $5,708 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by organic growth, partially offset by the negative impact of equity beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, and strategic pricing changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue of $368 million increased $70 million from $298 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher asset spreads and average balances of securities on loan.
Investment advisory performance fees of $153 million increased $63 million from $90 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from alternative and long-only equity products.
Technology services revenue of $552 million increased $111 million from $441 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin and the impact of the eFront acquisition, which closed in May of 2019.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2019
Expense decreased $4 million from the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by lower general and administration expense, largely offset by higher employee compensation and benefits expense.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $69 million from the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher base and incentive compensation, driven in part by higher performance fees.
General and administration expense decreased $82 million from the three months ended June 30, 2019, reflecting lower marketing and promotional expense, lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions and lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense, partially offset by higher technology expense, including certain costs related to COVID-19 and a $12 million impairment of a fixed asset incurred in the three months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease also reflected the impact of $59 million of product launch costs incurred in the three months ended June 30, 2019.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2019
Expense increased $909 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by higher general and administration expense, including the impact of the Charitable Contribution, higher employee compensation and benefits expense, and higher volume-related expense.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $142 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher base and incentive compensation, driven in part by higher operating income.
Direct fund expense increased $29 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019, reflecting higher average AUM.
General and administration expense increased $672 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily driven by the $589 million of expense related to the Charitable Contribution, higher product launch costs and higher technology expense, including certain costs related to COVID-19, costs related to certain legal matters, including Aviron Capital, LLC., and a $12 million impairment of a fixed asset. The increase was partially offset by lower marketing and promotional expense and lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the six months ended June 30, 2020.

2019. The six months ended June 30, 2019 included $14 million of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2019.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”), (collectively, “consolidated sponsored investment products”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2019 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment products to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 included $275 million and $141 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment products (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended June 30, 2020).
Accounts receivable at June 30, 2020 decreased $189 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower receivables from base fees, partially offset by higher securities lending and technology services receivables. Investments, including the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, decreased $318 million from December 31, 2019 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $58 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment) increased $661 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a net decrease in certain corporate minority investments, primarily related to the previously discussed Charitable Contribution of the remaining 20% stake in PennyMac.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at June 30, 2020 decreased $868 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to 2019 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by 2020 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at June 30, 2020 decreased $253 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower current income taxes payables. Other liabilities increased $584 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), partially offset by lower contingent liabilities related to certain acquisitions. Net deferred income tax liabilities at June 30, 2020 decreased $70 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with investment income and the income tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution, partially offset by the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $5,171 million and $5,489 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the consolidated sponsored investment products. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for the six months ended June 30, 2020 were $118 million and reflected $111 million of net investment purchases and $100 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $93 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for the six months ended June 30, 2020 were $729 million, primarily resulting from $1.8 billion of share repurchases, including $1.1 billion from PNC, $412 million in open market transactions and $270 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $1.2 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $2.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were as follows:

(2)
The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
(3)
Amounts do not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals, which are paid in the first quarter.
Total liquidity resources increased $503 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily reflecting $2.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings and cash flows from other operating activities, partially offset by cash payments of 2019 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.8 billion, including $1.1 billion from PNC, and cash dividend payments of $1.2 billion.
A significant portion of the Company’s $3,854 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
The Company continues to monitor its liquidity and capital resources due to the current pandemic. The Company’s liquidity and capital resources were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions during the six months ended June 30, 2020.
Share Repurchases. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company repurchased 0.8 million common shares in open market transactions under the share repurchase program for approximately $412 million. At June 30, 2020, there were 5.1 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.
Including the repurchase from PNC, which was in addition to the share repurchase authorization under the Company’s existing share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion of its common shares during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and has now completed its targeted level of share repurchases for the year, but will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2020 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in March 2020 to extend the maturity date to March 2025 (the “2020 credit facility”). The 2020 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2020 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2020 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at June 30, 2020. The 2020 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At June 30, 2020, the Company had no amount outstanding under the credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2020 credit facility. At June 30, 2020, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At June 30, 2020, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $7.2 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2019 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company paid approximately $90 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at June 30, 2020 were as follows:

The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of June 30, 2020.
In January 2020, the Company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.40% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on April 30, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2030 Notes were used for general corporate purposes. Interest of approximately $24 million per year is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year, which commenced on April 30, 2020. The 2030 Notes may be redeemed prior to January 30, 2030 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2030 Notes.
In April 2020, the Company issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.90% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on January 28, 2031 (the “2031 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2031 Notes are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include the future repayment of all or a portion of the $750 million 4.25% Notes due May 2021. Interest of approximately $24 million per year is payable semi-annually on January 28 and July 28 of each year, commencing on July 28, 2020. The 2031 Notes may be redeemed prior to October 28, 2030 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2031 Notes thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2031 Notes.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At June 30, 2020, the Company had $656 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated sponsored investment products. These products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at June 30, 2020 totaled $37 million and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of June 30, 2020 and subject to this type of indemnification was $234 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $251 billion were held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at June 30, 2020. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at June 30, 2020.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2019 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $418 million and $483 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 16, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.
Accounting Developments
For accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during the six months ended June 30, 2020, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in BlackRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, BlackRock’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and may adversely affect our business, including our operations and financial condition, and may cause our assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in authorities implementing numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact our business. While global markets have recovered to varying degrees since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on our business, including our operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of our investment portfolio, including our coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and our ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on our clients and key vendors, market participants and other third-parties with whom we do business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin® and/or our other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity risks; and
•
the disruption to our workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations on our remote work environment, and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on our products, clients, vendors and employees. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the other risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",1402.0,,0.0,19:42:49,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this report, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance and include: (1) a pandemic or health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on financial institutions, the global economy or capital markets, as well as BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees, and BlackRock’s results of operations, the full extent of which may be unknown; (2) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (3) changes and volatility in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management (“AUM”); (4) the relative and absolute investment performance of BlackRock’s investment products; (5) BlackRock’s ability to develop new products and services that address client preferences; (6) the impact of increased competition; (7) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (8) BlackRock’s ability to integrate acquired businesses successfully; (9) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (10) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (11) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property, information and cyber security protection; (12) attempts to circumvent BlackRock’s operational control environment or the potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems; (13) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to BlackRock; (14) changes in law and policy and uncertainty pending any such changes; (15) terrorist activities, international hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries or BlackRock; (16) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (17) fluctuations in the carrying value of BlackRock’s economic investments; (18) the impact of changes to tax legislation, including income, payroll and transaction taxes, and taxation on products or transactions, which could affect the value proposition to clients and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (19) BlackRock’s success in negotiating distribution arrangements and maintaining distribution channels for its products; (20) the failure by a key vendor of BlackRock to fulfill its obligations to the Company; (21) any disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds (“ETF”) platform; (22) the impact of BlackRock electing to provide support to its products from time to time and any potential liabilities related to securities lending or other indemnification obligations; and (23) the impact of problems at other financial institutions or the failure or negative performance of products at other financial institutions.
OVERVIEW
BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $7.81 trillion of AUM at September 30, 2020. With approximately 16,600 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.
BlackRock’s diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® ETFs, separate accounts, collective trust funds and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin®, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix and FutureAdvisor, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients.
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors; and retail investors.

On May 15, 2020, a subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) completed the secondary offering of 31,628,573 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $420 per share, which included 823,188 shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of the Company’s Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock and 2,875,325 shares of common stock under the fully exercised underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. Also on May 15, 2020, PNC completed the sale of 2,650,857 shares to the Company at a price of $414.96 per share. The shares repurchased by the Company were in addition to the share repurchase authorization under the Company’s existing share repurchase program. The secondary offering and the Company’s share repurchase resulted in PNC’s exit of its entire ownership position in the Company, other than 500,000 shares that PNC contributed to The PNC Foundation.
Certain prior period presentations and disclosures, while not required to be recast, were reclassified to ensure comparability with current period classifications.
COVID-19 Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in authorities taking numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact our business. While global markets have recovered to varying degrees since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on our business, including our operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of our investment portfolio, including our coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and our ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on our clients and key vendors, market participants and other third-parties with whom we do business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin and/or our other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity risks; and
•
the disruption to our workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations on our remote work environment, and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on our products, clients, vendors and employees. BlackRock continues to service clients amid uncertainty and disruption linked to COVID-19 and is actively managing its business to respond to the impact.
United Kingdom Exit from European Union
Following the June 2016 vote to exit the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as Brexit, the United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU on January 31, 2020 and entered an eleven-month transition period during which the UK, and UK-based entities, will retain the rights and obligations of EU membership.
Substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the UK and the EU, but the UK government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the EU before the end of the transition period rather than continuing Single Market or Customs Union membership. BlackRock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including the potential failure of the UK and the EU to negotiate an agreement before the transition period expires. These steps, many of which are time consuming and costly, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications, and are expected to add complexity to BlackRock’s European operations. In addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations during the transition period and post-Brexit, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Other Development
On February 13, 2020, BlackRock announced the establishment of The BlackRock Foundation (the “Foundation”) and the contribution of its remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (“PennyMac”) to the Foundation and the BlackRock Charitable Fund, which BlackRock established in 2013 (together, the “Charitable Contribution”). The Charitable Contribution resulted in an operating expense of $589 million, which was offset by a $122 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain on the contributed shares and a tax benefit of $241 million in the condensed consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The Charitable Contribution provides long-term funding for BlackRock’s philanthropic investments and partnerships. The general and administration expense, nonoperating gain and associated tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution have been excluded from as adjusted results.

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019
GAAP. Operating income of $1,757 million increased $255 million and operating margin of 40.2% decreased 50 bps from the third quarter of 2019. Operating income and operating margin reflected higher performance fees and continued organic growth, partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits expense and the impact of $83 million of product launch costs associated with the September 2020 close of the $2 billion BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) increased $113 million from the third quarter of 2019, primarily driven by mark-to-market gains on un-hedged seed and co-investment capital.
Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2020 included a $54 million noncash net expense, related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.72, or 24%, from the third quarter of 2019, driven primarily by higher operating and nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating margin of 47.0% increased 100 bps from the third quarter of 2019. Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2020 excluded the $54 million noncash net expense described above. Earnings per diluted common share increased $2.07, or 27%, from the third quarter of 2019.
NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 COMPARED WITH NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019
GAAP. Operating income of $3,847 million decreased $166 million and operating margin of 32.8% decreased 520 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Operating income and operating margin reflected higher investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue (collectively “base fees”), performance fees and technology services revenue, which were more than offset by higher expense, including the impact of $589 million related to the Charitable Contribution and higher product launch costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI increased $225 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, driven by the impact of a pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital Network, Inc. (“iCapital”) and $122 million pre-tax gain related to the Charitable Contribution, partially offset by lower mark-to-market gains on un-hedged seed capital investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 included $78 million of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2020. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution and a noncash net expense of approximately $54 million related to the legislation enacted in the United Kingdom described above. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.67 from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, reflecting higher revenue and nonoperating income, a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by the impact of the Charitable Contribution and higher product launch costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $4,436 million increased $423 million and operating margin of 44.3% increased 60 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Earnings per diluted common share increased $3.47, or 17%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to higher operating and nonoperating income, a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution and legislation enacted in the UK increasing its tax rate has been excluded from as adjusted results.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP“).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, included a non-GAAP expense adjustment during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The Charitable Contribution expense of $589 million has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $122 million related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, for information on the Charitable Contribution.
The nine months ended September 30, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the non-recurring nature of the Charitable Contribution. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
(4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(2)
Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing four months.
(3)
Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Approximately $4.2 billion of iShares ETFs AUM held in advisory accounts associated with the FRBNY assignment as of September 30, 2020 (disclosed via FRBNY reporting as of October 8, 2020) are included within Fixed Income iShares ETFs AUM or Fixed Income AUM above. These holdings are excluded from Advisory AUM.
(4)
Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM increased $490.5 billion to $7.81 trillion at September 30, 2020, driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows and the positive impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market appreciation of $288.1 billion was primarily driven by global equity market appreciation.
Long-term net inflows of $97.6 billion included $41.3 billion, $36.7 billion and $19.6 billion of net inflows into iShares ETFs, institutional and retail products, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $41.3 billion reflected continued growth in fixed income and sustainable ETFs and inflows into core equity and precision exposures. Core and non-Core iShares ETFs saw net inflows of $13.5 billion and $27.8 billion, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $27.6 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $11.8 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $19.6 billion were positive in both the US and internationally and across all major asset classes, reflecting strength in active fixed income, equity, liquid alternatives and multi-asset funds. Retail net inflows also included the September 2020 close of the $2 billion BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $29.6 billion were broad-based across all product categories and were led by fixed income net inflows, reflecting strong activity among insurance clients. Multi-asset net inflows were driven by continued growth in LifePath® target-date funds and OCIO clients.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $7.1 billion were primarily led by fixed income net inflows of $30.3 billion, partially offset by equity net outflows of $23.7 billion.
Cash management AUM increased to $652 billion, driven by net inflows of $27.8 billion.
AUM increased $73.8 billion due to the positive impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound and the Euro.

AUM increased $378.9 billion to $7.81 trillion at September 30, 2020, driven by positive net inflows and net market appreciation.
Net market appreciation of $106.2 billion was primarily driven by fixed income market appreciation, partially offset by deprecation in equity markets year to date.
Long-term net inflows of $141.2 billion included $106.1 billion, $34.2 billion and $30.3 billion of net inflows into iShares ETFs, retail and institutional active products, respectively, partially offset by net outflows $29.4 billion from institutional index clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $106.1 billion were led by growth in fixed income and sustainable ETFs. Core and non-Core iShares ETFs saw net inflows of $21.8 billion and $84.3 billion, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $66 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $32.4 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $34.2 billion primarily reflected net inflows from active equity, fixed income and alternative products, partially offset by net outflows from multi-asset world allocation strategies.
•
Institutional active inflows of $30.3 billion primarily reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, illiquid alternatives and systematic active equity.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $29.4 billion were primarily driven by equity net outflows of $38.1 billion, driven by client de-risking, reallocating, rebalancing and liquidity needs in a more uncertain market environment, partially offset by $8.3 billion of net inflows into fixed income.
Cash management AUM increased to $652 billion, driven by net inflows of $104.4 billion.
AUM increased $8.8 billion due to the positive impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar against the Euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound.

Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(2)
Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
(3)
Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Approximately $4.2 billion of iShares ETFs AUM held in advisory accounts associated with the FRBNY assignment as of September 30, 2020 (disclosed via FRBNY reporting as of October 8, 2020) are included within Fixed Income iShares ETFs AUM or Fixed Income AUM above. These holdings are excluded from Advisory AUM.
(4)
Amounts include commodity iShares ETFs.
AUM increased $844.6 billion to $7.81 trillion at September 30, 2020, driven by positive net inflows, net market appreciation and the positive impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market appreciation of $364.8 billion was driven by global equity and fixed income market appreciation.
Long-term net inflows of $240.2 billion were comprised of net inflows of $181.3 billion, $45.6 billion and $42.2 billion from iShares ETFs, institutional active and retail clients, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $28.9 billion from institutional index products. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
iShares ETFs net inflows of $181.3 billion reflected $48.8 billion and $132.5 billion of net inflows into Core and non-Core ETFs, respectively. By region, iShares ETFs inflows were diversified with $115 billion of net inflows in US-listed iShares ETFs and $53.7 billion of net inflows in European-listed iShares ETFs. Fixed income net inflows of $100.3 billion were led by flows into investment grade corporate bonds, high yield, treasuries and core bond ETFs. Equity net inflows of $60.1 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $45.6 billion primarily reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, illiquid alternatives and systematic active equity.
•
Retail net inflows of $42.2 billion primarily reflected net inflows of $21.2 billion and $19.7 billion in Americas and EMEA, respectively. Retail net inflows reflected strength in global equity and sector equity funds, high yield, total return and municipal fixed income funds, and alternative funds.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $28.9 billion were primarily driven by equity net outflows of $51 billion, driven by client de-risking, reallocating, rebalancing and liquidity needs in a more uncertain market environment, partially offset by $21.7 billion of net inflows into fixed income, driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions.
Cash management AUM increased to $652 billion, due to net inflows of $134.2 billion.
AUM increased $87 billion due to the positive impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the Euro and the British pound.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2019
Revenue increased $677 million, or 18%, from the three months ended September 30, 2019, reflecting higher performance fees and continued organic growth.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3,225 million increased $245 million from $2,980 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by organic growth, the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by strategic pricing changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue of $153 million in the current quarter compared with $150 million in the third quarter of 2019.
Investment advisory performance fees of $532 million increased $411 million from $121 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting strong performance from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter.
Technology services revenue of $282 million increased $23 million from $259 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin.
Advisory and other revenue of $42 million decreased $20 million from $62 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting the impact of the previously discussed Charitable Contribution of BlackRock’s remaining 20% stake in PennyMac in the first quarter of 2020.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019
Revenue increased $1,165 million, or 11%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, reflecting higher base fees, higher performance fees and higher technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $9,246 million increased $558 million from $8,688 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by organic growth, the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by strategic pricing changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue of $521 million increased $73 million from $448 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher asset spreads and average balances of securities on loan.
Investment advisory performance fees of $685 million increased $474 million from $211 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from alternative products including strong performance from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter.
Technology services revenue of $834 million increased $134 million from $700 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin and the impact of the eFront acquisition, which closed in May of 2019.

Expense increased $422 million from the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefits expense, and higher general and administration expense, including the impact of product launch costs in the current quarter.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $300 million from the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation associated with higher performance fees and operating income.
General and administration expense increased $76 million from the three months ended September 30, 2019, reflecting $80 million of previously described product launch costs. The increase also reflected higher technology expense, including certain costs related to COVID-19, and lower marketing and promotional expense.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019
Expense increased $1,331 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by higher general and administration expense, including the impact of the Charitable Contribution and higher product launch costs, higher employee compensation and benefits expense, and higher volume-related expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $442 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting higher base and incentive compensation, driven in part by higher performance fees and operating income.
Direct fund expense increased $47 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, reflecting higher average AUM.
General and administration expense increased $748 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by $589 million of expense related to the Charitable Contribution, higher product launch costs, higher technology expense, including certain costs related to COVID-19, costs related to certain legal matters, including Aviron Capital, LLC., and a $12 million impairment of a fixed asset. The increase was partially offset by lower marketing and promotional expense and lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”), (collectively, “consolidated sponsored investment products”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2019 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment products to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

Amounts include approximately $4.2 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles.
The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 included $208 million and $141 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment products (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended September 30, 2020).
Accounts receivable at September 30, 2020 increased $527 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher performance fee, technology services and base fee receivables. Investments, including the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, increased $818 million from December 31, 2019 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $87 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment) increased $739 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a net decrease in certain corporate minority investments, primarily related to the previously discussed Charitable Contribution of BlackRock’s remaining 20% stake in PennyMac.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at September 30, 2020 decreased $210 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to 2019 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by 2020 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at September 30, 2020 decreased $179 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower current income taxes payables. Other liabilities increased $697 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), partially offset by lower contingent liabilities related to certain acquisitions. Net deferred income tax liabilities at September 30, 2020 increased $8 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation and the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, partially offset by the effects of temporary differences associated with investment income and the income tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $6,307 million and $5,489 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the consolidated sponsored investment products. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $135 million and reflected $140 million of purchases of property and equipment and $119 million of net investment purchases, partially offset by $124 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $1.3 billion, primarily resulting from $1.8 billion of share repurchases, including $1.1 billion from PNC, $412 million in open market transactions and $280 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $1.7 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $2.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were as follows:

(2)
The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
(3)
Amounts do not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals, which are paid in the first quarter.
Total liquidity resources increased $1,611 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily reflecting $2.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings and cash flows from other operating activities, partially offset by cash payments of 2019 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.8 billion, including $1.1 billion from PNC, and cash dividend payments of $1.7 billion.
A significant portion of the Company’s $4,074 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
The Company continues to monitor its liquidity and capital resources due to the current pandemic. The Company’s liquidity and capital resources were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
Share Repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company repurchased 0.8 million common shares in open market transactions under the share repurchase program for approximately $412 million. At September 30, 2020, there were 5.1 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.
Including the repurchase from PNC, which was in addition to the share repurchase authorization under the Company’s existing share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion of its common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and has now completed its targeted level of share repurchases for the year, but will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2020 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in March 2020 to extend the maturity date to March 2025 (the “2020 credit facility”). The 2020 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2020 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2020 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at September 30, 2020. The 2020 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At September 30, 2020, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2020 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2020 credit facility. At September 30, 2020, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At September 30, 2020, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $7.3 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2019 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company paid approximately $124 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at September 30, 2020 were as follows:

__________________________
(1)
The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of September 30, 2020.
In January 2020, the Company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.40% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on April 30, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2030 Notes were used for general corporate purposes. Interest of approximately $24 million per year is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year, which commenced on April 30, 2020. The 2030 Notes may be redeemed prior to January 30, 2030 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2030 Notes.
In April 2020, the Company issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.90% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on January 28, 2031 (the “2031 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2031 Notes are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include the future repayment of all or a portion of the $750 million 4.25% Notes due May 2021. Interest of approximately $24 million per year is payable semi-annually on January 28 and July 28 of each year, which commenced on July 28, 2020. The 2031 Notes may be redeemed prior to October 28, 2030 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2031 Notes thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2031 Notes.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At September 30, 2020, the Company had $703 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated sponsored investment products. These products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at September 30, 2020 totaled $28 million and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of September 30, 2020 and subject to this type of indemnification was $249 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $265 billion were held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at September 30, 2020. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at September 30, 2020.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2019 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $447 million and $483 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 16, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.
Accounting Developments
For accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in BlackRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, BlackRock’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and may adversely affect our business, including our operations and financial condition, and may cause our assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in authorities taking numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact our business. While global markets have recovered to varying degrees since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on our business, including our operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of our investment portfolio, including our coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and our ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on our clients and key vendors, market participants and other third-parties with whom we do business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin® and/or our other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity risks; and
•
the disruption to our workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations on our remote work environment, and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on our products, clients, vendors and employees. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the other risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",1517.0,,0.0,14:59:31,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

Overview
BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $8.68 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2020. With approximately 16,500 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.
BlackRock’s diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), separate accounts, collective trust funds and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin®, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix and FutureAdvisor, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients. The Company is highly regulated and manages its clients’ assets as a fiduciary. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.
BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management and technology service relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through third-party distribution relationships, including financial professionals and pension consultants.
BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over 85% of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors.
Management seeks to deliver value for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on BlackRock’s differentiated competitive position, including:
•
the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for index products;
•
the Company’s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 50% of employees outside the United States serving clients locally and supporting local investment capabilities. Approximately 40% of total AUM is managed for clients domiciled outside the United States;
•
the Company’s breadth of investment strategies, including market-cap weighted index, factors, systematic active, traditional fundamental active, high conviction alpha and illiquid alternative product offerings, which enhance its ability to tailor whole-portfolio investment solutions to address specific client needs;
•
the Company’s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and macro trends including the secular shift to index investing and ETFs, a focus on income and retirement, increasing demand for sustainable investment strategies and barbelling using index, active and illiquid alternatives products; and
•
the Company’s longstanding commitment to innovation, technology services and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock technology products and solutions, including Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix, and FutureAdvisor. This commitment is further extended by minority investments in distribution technologies including Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Embark. In January 2021, BlackRock also announced a minority investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform.
BlackRock operates in a global marketplace impacted by changing market dynamics and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.
The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in Aladdin and other technology products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives, in a manner consistent with their risk preferences, to deliver excellent client service and to innovate in technology to serve clients’ evolving needs. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures.
See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures, for further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2020 and 2019.
In 2018 and 2016, a restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact BlackRock’s book value.
(3)
Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items referred to above and exclude the effect on deferred income tax expense resulting from certain income tax matters. In 2017, $1.2 billion of net tax benefit related to The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted.

Percentage represents CAGR over a five-year period (December 31, 2015 - December 31, 2020).
AUM represents the broad range of financial assets managed for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which BlackRock provides risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that the Company is retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.
Investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. BlackRock also earns performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, the Company also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, implementation go-lives, software solution delivery and support, and hosting services.
At December 31, 2020, total AUM was $8.68 trillion, representing a CAGR of 13% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including BofA Global Capital Management, which added $80.6 billion of AUM in 2016, the First Reserve Transaction, which added $3.3 billion of AUM in 2017 and the net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction, which added $27.5 billion of AUM in 2018. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.
The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:

Client Type
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, with a regionally focused business model. BlackRock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment, risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent.
Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.
iShares ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as iShares ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, iShares ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in iShares ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections.

BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the investment spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Technology solutions, digital distribution tools and a shift toward portfolio construction are increasing the number of financial advisors and end-retail clients using BlackRock products.
Retail represented 11% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2020 and 31% of long-term investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue (collectively “base fees”) for 2020.
iShares ETFs have a significant retail component but is shown separately below. With the exclusion of iShares ETFs, retail AUM is predominantly comprised of active mutual funds. Mutual funds totaled $694.9 billion, or 82%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. 86% of retail long-term AUM is invested in active products.

•
US retail long-term net inflows of $24.6 billion were led by fixed income net inflows of $10.1 billion. Fixed income net inflows were diversified across exposures and products, with strong flows into high yield, total return and core bond offerings. Equity net inflows of $7.5 billion were led by flows into high-performing technology, health sciences and US growth equities franchises. Alternatives net inflows of $4.2 billion were driven by flows into the BlackRock Alternative Capital Strategies and Global Event Driven funds. Multi-asset net inflows of $2.8 billion included the successful close of the $2.2 billion BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, BlackRock announced the acquisition of Aperio, a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts (“SMA”), to enhance our wealth platform and provide whole-portfolio solutions to ultra-high net worth advisors. By combining Aperio with BlackRock’s existing SMA franchise the Company plans to expand the breadth of personalization capabilities available to wealth managers from BlackRock via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance preferences across all asset classes. The transaction closed in February of 2021 and Aperio will operate as part of BlackRock’s US Wealth Advisory business.

International retail long-term net inflows of $45.0 billion were led by equity net inflows of $31.9 billion, reflecting strong flows into index equity mutual funds, and high-performing technology and health sciences active equity franchises.

iShares ETFs

The resilience and performance of iShares fixed income ETFs in periods of market disruption during the year drove increased confidence among investors that ETFs are valuable tools for liquidity, price transparency and market exposure, leading to strong inflows throughout 2020. iShares equity net inflows of $76.3 billion were driven by flows into sustainable and core equity ETFs. iShares Sustainable ETFs saw net inflows of $43.8 billion in 2020, primarily into equities, with AUM tripling to nearly $80 billion. iShares multi-asset and alternative ETFs contributed a combined $19.7 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities funds.

Institutional active AUM ended 2020 at $1.5 trillion, reflecting $31.6 billion of net inflows, positive across all asset classes. Multi-asset strategies saw continued growth, with net inflows of $13.6 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the LifePath® target-date suite.
Alternatives net inflows of $9.5 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure, private equity and private credit. Excluding return of capital and investment of $7.5 billion, alternatives net inflows were $17.0 billion. In addition, 2020 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, and at year-end 2020 BlackRock had approximately $24 billion of non-fee-earning committed capital to deploy for institutional clients, which is not included in AUM.
Institutional active represented 19% of long-term AUM and 20% of long-term base fees for 2020.
Institutional index AUM totaled $2.9 trillion at December 31, 2020, reflecting $28.7 billion of net outflows. Equity net outflows of $68.5 billion partially resulted from clients rebalancing portfolios after significant equity market gains, or tactically shifting assets to fixed income and cash. Fixed income net inflows of $39.7 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions.
Institutional index represented 37% of long-term AUM and 9% of long-term base fees for 2020.
The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:
•
Pensions, Foundations and Endowments. BlackRock is among the world’s largest managers of pension plan assets with $3.0 trillion, or 66%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2020. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, and our defined contribution channel represented $1.2 trillion of total pension AUM. BlackRock remains well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $76.9 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.
•
Official Institutions. BlackRock managed $275.4 billion, or 6%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2020. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.
•
Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $450.3 billion, or 10%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end 2020. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which the Company provides sub-advisory services, totaled $696.6 billion, or 16%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Long-term product offerings include alpha-seeking active and index strategies. Our alpha-seeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and iShares ETFs.
Although many clients use both alpha-seeking active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.
Equity
Year-end 2020 equity AUM totaled $4.4 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $49.0 billion. Net inflows included $76.3 billion and $30.2 billion into iShares ETFs and active, respectively, partially offset by non-ETF index net outflows of $57.5 billion. Record active equity net inflows were driven by flows into high-performing technology, health sciences and US growth fundamental equities franchises, as well as flows into quantitative strategies.
BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate.
Equity represented 55% of long-term AUM and 50% of long-term base fees for 2020.
Fixed Income
Fixed income AUM ended 2020 at $2.7 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $158.0 billion. iShares ETFs net inflows of $89.0 billion were led by flows into US investment grade corporate, core and high yield bond funds. Non-ETF index net inflows of $42.1 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions and index mutual funds. Active net inflows of $26.9 billion reflected strong flows in high yield, Asian, total return and core bond offerings.
Fixed income represented 34% of long-term AUM and 30% of long-term base fees for 2020.
Multi-Asset
BlackRock manages a variety of multi-asset balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.
Multi-asset represented 8% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees for 2020.

Multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $13.0 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed $14.8 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2020, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings.
The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:
•
Target date and target risk products generated net inflows of $21.3 billion. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 84% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation overlay model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products.
•
Asset allocation and balanced products represented 29% of multi-asset AUM at year-end. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families. This category also includes FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients’ investments.
•
Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.
Alternatives
BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into three main categories - 1) illiquid alternatives, 2) liquid alternatives, and 3) currency and commodities. Illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions, private equity, opportunistic and credit, real estate and infrastructure. Liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds).
In 2020, liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined $17.4 billion of net inflows, or $25.7 billion excluding return of capital/investment of $8.3 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital/investment were private equity solutions, infrastructure and opportunistic and credit strategies. Net inflows were driven by direct hedge funds, infrastructure, private equity and opportunistic and credit strategies. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $24 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying. Currency and commodities saw $19.8 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities iShares ETFs.
BlackRock believes that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. BlackRock’s highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to continue to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.
Alternatives represented 3% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees for 2020.

Illiquid Alternatives
The Company’s illiquid alternatives strategies include the following:
•
Alternative Solutions represents highly customized portfolios of alternative investments. In 2020, alternative solutions portfolios had $4.3 billion in AUM.
•
Private Equity and Opportunistic included AUM of $16.9 billion in private equity solutions, $13.0 billion in opportunistic and credit offerings, and $3.5 billion in Long Term Private Capital (“LTPC”). Net inflows of $5.4 billion into private equity and opportunistic strategies included $2.6 billion of net inflows into private equity solutions, $1.8 billion of net inflows into opportunistic and credit offerings and $1.0 billion of net inflows into LTPC.
•
Real Assets, which includes infrastructure and real estate, totaled $48.0 billion in AUM, reflecting net inflows of $5.3 billion, led by infrastructure deployments.
Liquid Alternatives
The Company’s liquid alternatives products’ net inflows of $6.5 billion reflected net inflows of $5.7 billion and $0.8 billion from direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions, respectively. Direct hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings.
Currency and Commodities
The Company’s currency and commodities products include a range of active and index products.
Currency and commodities products had $19.8 billion of net inflows, primarily driven by iShares ETFs. iShares ETFs commodities products represented $67.6 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.
Cash Management
Cash management AUM totaled $666.3 billion at December 31, 2020, reflecting a record $113.3 billion of net inflows. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds, short term investment funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs, New Taiwan Dollars or British pounds. Strong growth in cash management reflects BlackRock’s success in leveraging scale for clients and delivering innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions.
BlackRock is currently voluntarily waiving a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a minimum level of daily net investment income. During 2020, these waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $35 million, which was partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock’s distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. BlackRock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of yield support waivers in future periods. For more information see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, which serves as the investment and risk management system for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via Aladdin Risk, as well as investment accounting capabilities. Aladdin Provider is a tool used by BlackRock’s custodial partners, connecting them to the platform to add operational efficiency. In 2020, BlackRock launched Aladdin Climate, a software application offering investors measures of both the physical risk of climate change and the transition risk to a low-carbon economy on portfolios with climate-adjusted security valuations and risk metrics. In 2019, BlackRock acquired eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider to enable clients to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. Through our Cachematrix platform, BlackRock is also a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform.
BlackRock offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities, and FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients’ investments.
Technology services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 17% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and continued growth in Aladdin. Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue.
At year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in the digital distribution companies Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Embark. In January 2021, BlackRock also announced a minority investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense).
Securities Lending
Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash received as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.
Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $352 billion, up from $290 billion at year-end 2019. Continued asset gathering in lending products and strong market performance resulted in higher balances compared to 2019. On average, relative to 2019, intrinsic lending spreads were lower, while average cash reinvestment spreads increased. Cash reinvestment spreads increased significantly in the second quarter, primarily as a result of cuts to the Federal Funds Target rate band in March and market dislocations during the period.
BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.
Risk & Quantitative Analysis
Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.
COMPETITION
BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.
HUMAN CAPITAL
With approximately 16,500 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. As an asset manager, BlackRock’s long-term sustainability depends on its people and how it manages its workforce.
Culture and Principles
BlackRock believes that developing a strong corporate culture is an important component of its human capital management practices and critical to the firm’s long-term success. BlackRock’s culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify its workforce: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock; (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)
BlackRock believes a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive working environment are key factors in achieving better outcomes across all levels of its business. BlackRock has made a long-term commitment to cultivating diversity in its workforce and leadership team, through its hiring, retention, promotion and development practices. As part of its long-term commitment, BlackRock has instituted a multi-year DEI strategy that it believes is actionable, measurable and designed to apply across the many countries in which the firm operates. The Company has aligned its DEI strategy with the firm’s business priorities and long-term objectives and expects that it will evolve as the firm learns and adapts to a changing macro environment.
A key goal of BlackRock’s DEI strategy is developing a diverse talent pipeline through ongoing investment in recruiting, retention and engagement. In connection with this goal, the Company has: (1) expanded partnerships with external organizations and developed strategies to increase the diversity of its applicant pool; (2) strengthened talent acquisition and management processes in an effort to eliminate bias; and (3) implemented leadership development, sponsorship and coaching initiatives to engage and develop diverse talent. Another focus of BlackRock’s DEI strategy is to cultivate an inclusive work environment in which employees feel connected to BlackRock’s culture and supported in pursuit of their goals. To this end, BlackRock has committed to raising awareness of racial equity issues and resetting behavioral expectations for employees, as well as to holding firm leaders and managers accountable for continued progress against the firm’s goals.
BlackRock views transparency and accountability as a critical part of its DEI strategy, including as a means to inform, measure and improve its human capital management practices. To that end, in 2020 the firm published its first SASB-aligned disclosure, which includes information regarding workforce diversity that BlackRock plans to update annually. During 2020, it also set goals for increasing the overall workplace representation of Black and Latinx employees and growing the number of female, and US Black and Latinx, leaders (Director and above).
Board Oversight of Human Capital Management
BlackRock’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management at BlackRock and devotes one full Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock’s culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, DEI strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, year-end business assessments, which include a review of the progress that is being made against the firm’s DEI goals, influence individual compensation outcomes that are reviewed and approved by the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee.
Succession planning for BlackRock’s Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives is a key part of the Board’s annual review of human capital management issues. As part of this review, the Board focuses on whether BlackRock has the right people in place to execute the Company’s long-term strategic plans, and on BlackRock’s ability to identify, attract, develop and retain future senior executives. An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within and increasing diversity in leadership roles.
Employee Engagement
BlackRock prioritizes continuous dialogue with its employees about their experiences at the firm in order to understand employee expectations and assess the efficacy of its human capital management practices. The Company uses several employee feedback mechanisms, including: (i) employee opinion surveys; (ii) interactive townhalls and communications; and (iii) the sponsorship of employee, professional and social impact networks. These employee engagement mechanisms provide BlackRock with actionable feedback for each team and for BlackRock as a whole. BlackRock’s employee, professional and social impact networks also provide additional forums and opportunities for employees with diverse backgrounds to connect with one another and shape the firm’s culture. More recently, these networks played an active role in BlackRock’s response to COVID-19, including by instituting programs to combat isolation and more deeply understand the employee experience during the pandemic. The networks, which continue to grow in number, are sponsored by senior leaders and designed by employees, for employees.
Compensation, Wellness and Benefits
BlackRock is committed to responsible business practices and believes that investing in the physical, emotional, mental and financial well-being of its employees is a critical component of the firm’s human capital management strategy. To that end, the Company designs its compensation and benefits practices to: (i) attract and retain employees; (ii) align employee incentives and risk taking with that of the firm’s and the interests of its clients; and (iii) support employees across many aspects of their lives. The Company has a strong pay-for-performance culture and an
annual compensation process that takes into consideration firmwide results, individual business results and employee performance, as well as market benchmarks. BlackRock also offers a wide range of benefits that it regularly reviews in accordance with industry best practices and the local requirements of its offices, including retirement savings plans, a Flexible Time Off (“FTO”) policy and flexible working arrangements, and parental leave and family support benefits, including fertility benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, and backup elder and childcare benefits. The Company provides comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, counseling services, an employee assistance program and access to telemedicine services.
BlackRock prioritizes protecting the rights of its workforce and the equitable treatment of its employees. The Company has implemented policies related to harassment prevention and compliance with equal employment opportunity and overtime regulations. BlackRock is also committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment for its workforce. To do this, it designs global programs, including environmental and occupational health and safety programs, to meet or exceed local requirements. Moreover, BlackRock encourages all of its employees to raise issues of concern and assures employees that they may do so without fear of retaliation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy and, following its onset, BlackRock implemented several initiatives to support employees. The Company prioritized communication about the telemedicine and digital health resources it makes available, including mental, emotional and physical health offerings. In addition, BlackRock extended cross-border healthcare coverage and support to employees and their dependents temporarily working, or on FTO, outside of their home country as a result of the pandemic.
Training, Innovation and Development
BlackRock is committed to innovation, learning and reinvention in all areas of its business and believes that developing the capabilities of its employees is integral to delivering long-term value. To that end, the Company’s human capital management practices are designed to provide opportunities for employees to learn, innovate and enhance their skillsets at every stage of their career. These opportunities, which include the firm’s comprehensive online suite of interactive resources and courses (BlackRock Academies), play an important role in engaging BlackRock’s employees.
In addition, BlackRock believes that developing strong leaders is a driver of the firm’s success. Select employees are invited to participate in leadership programs to help accelerate their growth, which include executive coaching, in-person and virtual learning, and senior management sponsorship.
REGULATION
Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock.
The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.
GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM
BlackRock’s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.
Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) Review
The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”). In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. In December 2019, the FSOC re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. This reduces the risk of entity-level designation, however it remains too early to predict the direction of the forthcoming regulatory environment and the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “Federal Reserve”).
Federal Trade Commission Proposal
In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing updates to premerger notification rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index-funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where making a pre-merger notification may not be practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock’s aggregate position in certain issuers.
Taxation
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the European Union (“EU”), certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission (“EC”) has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, any such limitations or restrictions could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.
In October 2020, the SEC adopted new regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (“RICs”), including mutual funds (other than money market funds), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. RICs will be required to implement and comply with the new rule by the third quarter of 2022. Once implemented, the rule will, among other things, impose limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a RIC can enter into, eliminate the current asset segregation compliance framework and introduce new compliance requirements for funds, including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs. The rule may impact certain RICs’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy.
Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements.
In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to Dodd-Frank central clearing and trading venue execution requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. On March 1, 2017, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, became subject to requirements in the US, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks.
Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds
As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of ETFs in the markets, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other sponsors of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased
regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company’s business.
Regulation of Money Market Funds
In October 2016, rules were implemented to reform the regulatory structure governing US money market funds to address perceived systemic risks of money market funds. The rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Retail money market funds continue operating with a constant net asset value per share. The rules additionally provide for tools for institutional and retail money market funds’ boards designed to address market shocks, including the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances.
In addition, following market liquidity issues that arose in March 2020 in connection with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities are focused on the need for further regulation for certain money market funds. In December 2020, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets issued a report outlining ten potential policy measures for consideration to improve the resiliency of money market funds and the broader short-term funding markets. Although it remains too early to accurately predict the forthcoming regulatory environment, including with respect to regulation of money market funds, certain of these reforms, if ever adopted, could significantly impact money market funds and the money market fund industry.
Standards of Conduct Rulemaking
In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and broker-dealer standards of conduct. The package includes new rules requiring registered advisers and registered broker-dealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers and two new interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). These rulemakings and interpretations could increase BlackRock’s disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain other services to its clients.
Securities and Exchange Commission Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers
BlackRock’s business may also be impacted by SEC regulatory initiatives. The SEC and its staff recently have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. Over the past year, the SEC has adopted rules that include among other things: (i) a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures; and (ii) updated eligibility requirements for submitting shareholder proposals under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These rules, and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the SEC's efforts, may increase BlackRock’s regulatory compliance requirements as well as disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock’s growth.
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers
In 2015, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Proposed Rule”) that would extend to a number of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Advisers Act, the requirement to establish written risk-based anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”). The Proposed Rule would include investment advisers within the Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of “financial institutions”, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements. If adopted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs.
British Exit from the EU
On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU, and the UK and EU reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. Although an “EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement” was agreed to in connection with the UK’s departure from the EU, it does not include any substantive provisions with respect to financial services. As a result, from January 1, 2021, cross-border financial services trade between the UK and the EU will be governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock has implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which are and have been time consuming and costly and may add complexity to BlackRock’s future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regards to delegation and outsourcing, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
UK Overseas Funds Regime
As part of its post-EU membership regulatory review, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) is reviewing the requirements it will impose on EU-domiciled funds offered into the UK. Any new requirements could introduce cost and complexity to BlackRock’s cross-border business model.
Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms
There has been growing regulatory scrutiny of technology service providers on which financial services firms are reliant, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which was proposed by the EC in September 2020 and focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology- and data services. If enacted as proposed, DORA may, among other things: (i) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, testing and information sharing requirements to a number of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (ii) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. Separately, in November 2020, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”)
released a Consultation on Regulatory and Supervisory Issues Relating to Outsourcing and Third-Party Relationships, which explores direct supervision of technology service providers to financial services firms, in addition to detailing concerns around the potential for systemic risk in the provision of such services.
Reform of Investment Markets
BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company’s provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The Regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms, which came into force in January 2018, were substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. Forthcoming proposals to review the operation of MiFID II and to develop a new EU Retail Investment Strategy may affect the European market structure and impact BlackRock’s ability to operate in European markets. The broad nature of the MiFID II means future reforms could also affect product development, client servicing and distribution models. Similar reforms have been introduced in Switzerland and Australia.
Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers
Certain policymakers continue to raise long-standing concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns and prompted a broad review of existing financial market regulations by international standard setters and regulators across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural components of current markets in mitigating risks. In the event that either the longer-standing concerns or recent broad review result in regulatory or policy action, macroprudential tools may begin to apply to open-ended investment funds broadly. BlackRock may also be required to make changes to structural features of certain open-ended investment funds. Either eventuality could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.
Revised Capital Requirements for Investment Firms
In December 2017, the EC published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms. The proposal passed the EU legislative process and the final texts of the Regulation and Directive were published in December 2019. The new legislative package, which comes into effect in 2021, will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital BlackRock is required to hold in the EU and how such capital is calculated, as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK is also proposing the adoption of comparable rules, which will apply to UK-based investment firms from 2022.
EU Market Access
The EC and certain EU Member States have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for a third country (i.e. non-EU country) to obtain “equivalence,” which is the process by which the legal, regulatory, and/or supervisory system in non-EU Member States is recognised by the EC as comparably effective to that in the EU, thereby allowing firms established in such non-EU Member States a degree of access to the EU single market in financial services. In addition, in 2019, the EC commenced a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) to assess, among other things, the conditions for delegating portfolio management mandates to third countries, the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes. To the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and EU market access rights for asset management firms with non-EU operations, or extends more stringent rules to the Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”), BlackRock’s ability to offer collective investment funds and certain investment services to EU-based clients may be adversely affected.
Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”)
In the UK, the FCA extended the SMCR to all financial services firms in December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.
UK Asset Management Market Study
The FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer “value” to investors. In 2020, the Company initiated the provision of an annual assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If “value” has not been provided to consumers, the Company will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA’s final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and the UK regulatory regime was revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA’s remedies could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.
Sustainability Regulation
In 2018, EC introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investments products, and issuers; and require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors. Rules arising from the reform proposals will take effect in March 2021. Regulators in Asia have been similarly focused on sustainability reform initiatives. In December 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore finalized its Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management for the asset management industry. The guidelines set forth enhanced environmental risk assessment, monitoring and oversight practices that certain funds registered or licensed in
Singapore will be required to implement over an 18-month transition period. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission proposed similar enhancements to sustainability risk management practices and disclosure requirements for funds in a Consultation Paper it issued in October 2020.
Securities Financing Transaction Regulation (“SFTR”)
In November 2015, the EU introduced a regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions and total return swaps. The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. During 2020, additional obligations became effective under the SFTR that require BlackRock to submit additional transaction reports with substantive details of trading activity to authorities. Compliance with the SFTR may subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock’s securities financing transaction activities.
Central Securities Depository Regulation (“CSDR”)
A settlement discipline regime introduced by the CSDR will become effective in February 2022. The regime includes measures to address settlement failures including rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions and mandatory buy-in requirements. To the extent left unchanged by a review that is scheduled to take place during 2021, the regime will require BlackRock to introduce operational mechanisms to facilitate the mandatory buy-in of securities in instances where the seller fails to deliver securities in a timely manner which, if not complied with, may subject BlackRock to penalty.
Cessation of LIBOR
The FCA, which regulates the administrator of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) has announced that it will no longer compel panel banks to submit rates for LIBOR after year-end 2021. As a result, sterling LIBOR and certain other indices which are utilized as benchmarks may no longer be published. The disappearance, or change in the manner of administration, of these benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for any BlackRock investments in instruments and securities linked to such benchmarks. BlackRock may also face operational challenges adopting successor benchmarks.
EXISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (“DoL”), the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the FTC, the Department of Justice, the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies.
Certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through Attorneys General, Insurance Commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities.
The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Exchange Act, as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, Dodd-Frank requires one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”). The rules subject BTC to additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.
BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, real estate funds, collective trust funds, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA.
BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of Dodd-Frank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. In addition, two of BlackRock’s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also a member of the MSRB and is subject to MSRB rules.
In July 2020, BlackRock’s business activity in California that involves the processing of personal information became subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA imposes obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA may result in fines, heightened regulatory scrutiny and/or reputational harm.
US Banking Regulation
One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC’s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders.
US Regulation of Securities Financing Transactions
In its 2014 Annual Report, FSOC identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions.
EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.
Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.
Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.
European Regulation
The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branches of certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business requirements, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and theme-based reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.
In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established, including the branches of the Netherlands entity which operate across the EU.
BlackRock’s EU-subsidiaries and branches must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID and its accompanying Regulation. BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries must comply with the UK version of MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities in the UK. MiFID II, and the UK equivalent of MiFID II, sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. The legislation also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock UK subsidiaries must also comply with the UK regulation which implements the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms. These include requirements on capital, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, as implemented in the relevant EU jurisdictions or in the UK, which impose obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of retail and alternative investment funds respectively that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will affect certain of BlackRock’s European operations. Compliance with the UCITS Directives and the AIFMD may subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements.
BlackRock’s European-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (or the UK equivalent regulation in the case of BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of certain over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives; (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties); and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) registered or recognized derivatives trade repository (or a UK authorized trade repository in the case of the UK version of EMIR).
The EU has seen an increase in Common Supervisory Actions by ESMA to coordinate supervisory action by national EU regulators, most notably in areas such as product governance, liquidity management and fund costs and charges. BlackRock’s European operations may be affected to the extent this initiative results in formal legislation or action.
EU Member States and many other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of data breaches. For example, in May 2018, the EU Data Protection Directive was replaced by a more extensive General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). In addition, the UK incorporated GDPR into an equivalent UK law (“UK GDPR”) that became effective when it left the EU on January 1, 2021. GDPR and UK GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock’s collection, processing and retention of personal data and reporting of data breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.
Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region
In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (“FIEA”) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEA. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act.
In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws, and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services activities in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection.
The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector.
BlackRock has obtained the approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for setting up a Fund Management Company (“FMC”) and approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission for setting up a Wealth Management Joint Venture Company (“WMC”) with Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd and China Construction Bank Corp in China. BlackRock is preparing for the next stages of the regulatory license applications process prior to being issued with final regulatory approvals and the launch of its first investment products for both the FMC and WMC.
Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.

As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, reputational, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.
MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS
Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, could cause:
•
the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;
•
the withdrawal of funds from BlackRock’s products in favor of products offered by competitors;
•
the rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;
•
an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•
a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.
The occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock’s AUM and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s net income and operating cash flows.
In recent years, there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates, interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates. BlackRock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Similarly, due to the global nature of BlackRock’s operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the US dollar. Any failure by BlackRock to manage movements in foreign exchange rates relative to the US dollar or its exposure to interest rates may cause BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s base fees, net income and operating cash flows.
In addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees.
BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund’s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance.
Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The investment management industry is highly competitive and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, over the past several years there has been significant consolidation in the asset management and financial services industries as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multi-asset investment capabilities and technological expertise, including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs. This consolidation, together with the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and
remain competitive with the products, services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock’s competitive success. Aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform flexibility or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, to the extent that Aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than BlackRock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, BlackRock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in Aladdin.
BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk.
BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. Conversely, the development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of products with a focus on environmental, social and governance matters, requires continued innovative effort on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timescale they require. Any failure to develop new products and services, or successfully manage associated operational risks, could harm BlackRock’s reputation and expose the Company to additional costs, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.
At December 31, 2020, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $2.9 billion in its investments (see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as other minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline.
BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.
BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2020 and subject to this type of indemnification was $270 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $289 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2020. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Any decision by BlackRock to support products may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. BlackRock’s ability to support certain products may be restricted by regulation or by the Company’s failure to have or make available sufficient capital or liquidity. Moreover, inherent constraints arising from the business models of certain asset managers, including BlackRock, may during periods of market volatility result in BlackRock having fewer options for accessing liquidity than asset managers with alternate business models, which may adversely impact its ability to support certain products. Any decision by BlackRock to support particular products, or the inability to provide such support, may result in losses, which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock’s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, European fragmentation, unrest in the Middle East and terrorist activity, as well as acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock’s control, including natural disasters, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension. Any such events, and responses thereto, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company’s products, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackRock currently operates or is seeking to expand its presence.
Risks Related to INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE
Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:
•
client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors;
•
client shifts to products that charge lower fees;
•
the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;
•
reduced, minimal or no performance fees;
•
an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•
a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital.
Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.
A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $1.1 billion, or 7%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company’s performance fee generating assets. In particular, as BlackRock takes on more advisory assignments for illiquid investments, performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products.
Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.
BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions, as well as any failure of BlackRock’s governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models or model assumptions, could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock’s business and reputation.
RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect BlackRock’s business, operations and financial condition which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and may adversely affect BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in governmental authorities taking numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact BlackRock’s business. While global markets have significantly recovered since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of BlackRock’s investment portfolio, including its coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and BlackRock’s ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on BlackRock’s clients, and key vendors (such as pricing providers), market participants and other third-parties with whom it does business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin and/or BlackRock’s other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity and fraud risks;
•
the possibility that prolonged periods away from physical office locations and daily in-person interactions with colleagues may cause members of BlackRock’s workforce to become disconnected with corporate culture and policies, which may increase operational issues arising from human error and/or individual attempts to circumvent controls due to distractions, fatigue or a lack of oversight; and
•
the disruption to BlackRock’s workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations of its remote work environment (including any complications associated with hiring and onboarding new employees remotely), and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees and may exacerbate the other risks described herein.
TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS
A failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock’s operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the Company’s reputation and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London, Budapest, Atlanta and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), health crisis or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt BlackRock’s operations in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth.
In addition, despite BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.
A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack including a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, or denial-of-service or ransomware attack, or an internally caused incident, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, developments in BlackRock’s use of process automation, as well as the increased use of remote access by employees and mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock’s control. BlackRock’s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.
There have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information and the unauthorized transfer of customer funds, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors and terrorist organizations. BlackRock has been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and cause financial losses. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to strengthen its computer systems, processes, software, technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock’s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock’s systems.
In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.
Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
BlackRock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. In so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers. For example, Aladdin’s data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to Aladdin’s growth. In addition, the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin’s analytical calculations. Although BlackRock has implemented internal controls and procedures, and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the Aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. Any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with Aladdin’s size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise Aladdin’s resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients.
Continuing enhancements to Aladdin’s capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.
The operation of BlackRock’s Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, configuration change management, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. These updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose BlackRock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
In addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions.
Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.
BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. In addition, while BlackRock, Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements, certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards, which require them to maintain certain levels of capital and liquidity. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.
Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses.
BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks.
Inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.
BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, deliver whole-portfolio solutions, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures, entering into
strategic joint ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions. The success of BlackRock’s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock’s inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products or business lines or are delivered via technology that differs from that employed by BlackRock. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock’s control. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry.
Client investments in real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.
BlackRock makes investments on behalf of its clients in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, that may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. These may include:
•
construction risks, including as a result of force majeure, labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;
•
accidents, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), health crises or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control;
•
risks associated with global climate change, including the greater frequency or intensity of adverse weather and natural disasters;
•
personal injury or property damage;
•
failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;
•
exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;
•
environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;
•
changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;
•
the financial resources of tenants; and
•
contingent liabilities on disposition of assets.
The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock’s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management’s attention away from BlackRock’s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks.
As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Operating outside the United States (“US”) may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher compliance costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. Similarly, certain jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates may not have comparable levels of protection for corporate assets, such as intellectual property, and client information and records, as the US. As a result, there may also be heightened information security or privacy risks in those jurisdictions. Any theft of data, technology or intellectual property may negatively impact BlackRock’s business operations and reputation. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL
The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Many of BlackRock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock’s operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, or errors in judgment. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks. Notwithstanding these measures, BlackRock cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks and BlackRock employees have in the past engaged in improper conduct. In addition, BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may in the future deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. This risk may be heightened as BlackRock expands into new markets and increases the breadth of its business offerings, both of which introduce additional complexity to its risk management program. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, cause adverse publicity, and result in litigation, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company’s reputation and workplace culture, the immigration policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.
In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, if BlackRock’s share price were to decrease, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.
Risks Related to KEY THIRD-PARTY Relationships
The impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that BlackRock manages, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose BlackRock’s clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock maintains a robust vendor management program and regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. Counterparties may also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk management systems or expose BlackRock and/or its clients to losses on account of employee malfeasance, negligence or human error. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackRock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple BlackRock clients. Any such operational issue, impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts that BlackRock manages for its clients, which may lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key vendors could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market data, market indices, technology and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients’ investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock’s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. While BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock’s arrangement with a
vendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.
BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex, and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management or other agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company’s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock.
Key technology partnerships may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory oversight, as well as migration, execution, technology and operational risks.
In April 2020, BlackRock announced a strategic partnership to host Aladdin infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure cloud and commenced a multi-year plan to migrate the Aladdin environments for BlackRock and its external Aladdin clients to the cloud. The benefits of a cloud-based platform are significant and BlackRock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its migration strategy; however the partnership also introduces new risks, including: (i) risks associated with relying on a third-party for aspects of the reliability and stability of Aladdin’s infrastructure; (ii) software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology; (iii) operational and execution risks, including those related to migration; and (iv) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations. Any failure by BlackRock to manage these risks, and/or risks associated with future potential technology partnerships, may result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s Exchange-Traded Fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.
BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value (“NAV”). The NAV of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF’s holdings. The trading price of the ETF’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. The creation/redemption feature and arbitrage mechanism of an ETF are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the NAV. Notwithstanding these features, exchange prices have in the past deviated measurably from the NAV of certain ETFs and may under certain circumstances do so in the future. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, and the inability or unwillingness of market makers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively. These risks may be heightened as a result of significant market volatility, the accelerating growth of the ETF industry combined with increased market activity, as well as the complexity associated with the growing demand for product customization. Although certain structural improvements have contributed to the increasing resilience, stability and transparency of ETF markets, including during periods of volatility, and despite BlackRock’s continuing work with regulators and other third parties to implement additional ETF reforms, there can be no assurance that any such reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate meaningfully from an ETF’s NAV, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Legal, Regulatory and reputationAL Risks
BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world.
BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. In addition, many of BlackRock’s legal entities may be subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the UK Bribery Act, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations and the European Union (“EU”) and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which BlackRock operates, such as Her Majesty’s Treasury’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation. BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the General Data Protection Regulation, which expands data protection rules for individuals within the EU and for personal data exported outside the EU. BlackRock is additionally subject to scrutiny from various government agencies that focus on antitrust and competition laws and regulations within the US and internationally, including in connection with merger control proceedings and proposed investments. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or
sanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company’s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted.
BlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BlackRock’s bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see Item 1, Business - Regulation.
Regulatory reforms in the United States expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
In recent years a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the United States, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, or may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the United States, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:
•
Designation as a systemically important financial institution (“SIFI”): The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. In December 2019, the FSOC re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. This reduces the risk of an entity-level designation, however it remains too early to predict the direction of the forthcoming regulatory environment and the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.
•
Federal Trade Commission Proposal: In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing updates to premerger notification rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index-funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where making a pre-merger notification may not be practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock’s aggregate position in certain issuers.
•
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC and its staff recently have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. Over the past year, the SEC has adopted rules that include among other things: (i) the regulation of the use of derivatives; (ii) a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures; and (iii) updated eligibility requirements for submitting shareholder proposals under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules, and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the SEC's efforts, may increase BlackRock’s regulatory compliance requirements as well as disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock’s growth.
•
Standards of Conduct Rulemaking: In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and broker-dealer standards of conduct. The package included new rules requiring registered advisers and registered broker-dealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers, and two new interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These rulemakings and interpretations could increase BlackRock’s disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain other services to its clients.
•
Money Market Reform: Following market liquidity issues that arose in March 2020 in connection with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities are focused on the need for further regulation for certain money market funds. In December 2020, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets issued a report outlining ten potential policy measures for consideration to improve the resiliency of money market funds and the broader short-term funding markets. Although it remains too early to accurately predict the forthcoming regulatory environment, including with respect to regulation of money market funds, certain of these reforms, if ever adopted, could significantly impact money market funds and the money market fund industry.
Regulatory reforms in the United States could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be costly, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
BlackRock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the United States and the Company may be affected by a number of proposed or fully or partially implemented reform initiatives in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty, including:
•
British Exit from the EU: On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU, and the UK and EU reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. Although an “EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement” was agreed to in connection with the UK’s departure from the EU, it does not include any substantive provisions with respect to financial services. As a result, from January 1, 2021, cross-border financial services trade between the UK and the EU will be governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock has implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which are and have been time consuming and costly and may add complexity to BlackRock’s future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regards to delegation and outsourcing, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
•
UK Overseas Funds Regime: As part of its post-EU membership regulatory review, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) is reviewing the requirements it will impose on EU-domiciled funds offered into the UK. Any new requirements could introduce cost and complexity to BlackRock’s cross-border business model.
•
Enhanced regulatory scrutiny of technology service providers to financial services firms: There has been growing regulatory scrutiny of technology service providers on which financial services firms are reliant, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which was proposed by the EC in September 2020 and focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services. If enacted as proposed, DORA may, among other things: (i) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, testing and information sharing requirements to a number of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (ii) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. Separately, in November 2020, the Financial Stability Board released a Consultation on Regulatory and Supervisory Issues Relating to Outsourcing and Third-Party Relationships, which explores direct supervision of technology service providers to financial services firms, in addition to detailing concerns around the potential for systemic risk in the provision of such services.
•
Macroprudential policies for asset managers: Certain policymakers continue to raise long-standing concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns and prompted a broad review of existing financial market regulations by international standard setters and regulators across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural components of current markets in mitigating risks. In the event that either the longer-standing concerns or recent broad review result in regulatory or policy action, macroprudential tools may begin to apply to open-ended investment funds broadly. BlackRock may also be required to make changes to structural features of certain open-ended investment funds. Either eventuality could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.
•
Revised capital requirements for investment firms: In December 2017, the European Commission (“EC”) published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for Markets in Financial Instruments Directive investment firms. The proposal passed the EU legislative process and the final texts of the Regulation and Directive were published in December 2019. The new legislative package, which comes into effect in 2021, will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital BlackRock is required to hold in the EU and how such capital is calculated, as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK is also proposing the adoption of comparable rules, which will apply to UK-based investment firms from 2022.
•
EU market access: In 2019, the EC commenced a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive to assess, among other things, the conditions for delegating portfolio management mandates to third countries, the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes. To the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and EU market access rights for asset management firms with non-EU operations, or extends more stringent rules to the Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”), BlackRock’s ability to offer collective investment funds and certain investment services to EU-based clients may be adversely affected.
•
Senior Managers and Certification Regime: In the UK, the FCA extended the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”) to all financial services firms in December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.

UK asset management market study: The FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer “value” to investors. In 2020, the Company initiated the provision of an annual assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If “value” has not been provided to consumers, the Company will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA’s final report identified a number of competition
issues in such markets and the UK regulatory regime was revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA’s remedies could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.

Sustainability Regulation: In 2018, the EC introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investments products, and issuers; and require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors. Rules arising from the reform proposals will take effect in March 2021. Regulators in Asia have been similarly focused on sustainability reform initiatives. In December 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore finalized its Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management for the asset management industry. The guidelines set forth enhanced environmental risk assessment, monitoring and oversight practices that certain funds registered or licensed in Singapore will be required to implement over an 18-month transition period. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission proposed similar enhancements to sustainability risk management practices and disclosure requirements for funds in a Consultation Paper it issued in October 2020.
•
Securities Financing Transaction Regulation (“SFTR”): In November 2015, the EU introduced a regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions and total return swaps. The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. During 2020, additional obligations became effective under the SFTR that require BlackRock to submit additional transaction reports with substantive details of trading activity to authorities. Compliance with the SFTR may subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock’s securities financing transaction activities.

Central Securities Depository Regulation: A settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation will become effective in February 2022. The regime includes measures to address settlement failures including rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions and mandatory buy-in requirements. To the extent left unchanged by a review that is scheduled to take place during 2021, the regime will require BlackRock to introduce operational mechanisms to facilitate the mandatory buy-in of securities in instances where the seller fails to deliver securities in a timely manner which, if not complied with, may subject BlackRock to penalty.
International regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s internationally-based clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financial and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US and non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock’s shareholders, which could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.
In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.
Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may harm its business.
BlackRock’s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients, employees, shareholders and business partners. BlackRock’s reputation may be harmed by, among other factors, regulatory or enforcement actions, technology or operational failures, poor investment performance, ineffective management or monitoring of key third-party relationships, cyber-security or other privacy incidents, employee errors or misconduct, a failure to manage environmental, social, and governance risks, or a failure to manage conflicts of interest. In addition, BlackRock’s business, scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders. This heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity for BlackRock in the past and may do so in the future. In addition, the increasing popularity of social media and non-mainstream Internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of any adverse publicity or inaccurate information about BlackRock, making effective remediation more difficult. Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may impact BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
A failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions and/or adversely affect BlackRock’s business and reputation, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
As a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients, the Company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. While BlackRock has policies, controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest, identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny. It is possible that
actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction, adverse publicity, litigation or enforcement actions. In particular, BlackRock’s broad range of investment, advisory and technology offerings, and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions, may result in clients working with multiple BlackRock businesses and/or BlackRock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. To the extent that BlackRock fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face adverse publicity, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, client attrition, penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCC regulation and capital requirements. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.
The implications of complying with threshold limits and/or any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation, impact the performance of certain BlackRock funds and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Of note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Moreover, as BlackRock’s business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory, industry-level or issuer-specific threshold limits that may prevent BlackRock from holding positions in certain equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds. Although BlackRock is actively engaged in regulatory, issuer-specific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity, threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may, in turn, impact the performance of certain BlackRock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds’ benchmarks and impact the performance of certain BlackRock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities.
BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership.
As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as “common ownership”. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. Additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation, among other things. In the US, the FTC during 2018 held hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century, which included a discussion of common ownership, and in 2020, common ownership was cited as a disqualifying factor in a newly proposed exemption from the FTC’s pre-merger notification rules. Common ownership was also cited as a consideration underlying the FTC’s consultation on the rules that apply to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities. Although the FTC acknowledged that the common ownership debate remains unsettled, it is expected that common ownership may be given greater consideration in connection with FTC rule proposals, policy decisions and/or the scrutiny of mergers. In the EU, both the EC and the European Parliament released reports in 2020 on common ownership. Neither report took a position that common ownership had an adverse impact on competition. It is expected that common ownership will continue to be a focus for the EC, among others, including in the assessment of mergers and investigations. There is substantial literature highlighting the benefits of index investing, as well as casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments. Nevertheless, some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on stakes managed by asset managers that, if enacted into policy, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, increase transaction costs and limit the availability of products for investors. This may, in turn, adversely affect BlackRock.
New tax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the EC has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.",,,,,5286.0,,0.0,15:55:29,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

(together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $9.01 trillion of AUM at March 31, 2021. With approximately 16,700 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.
BlackRock’s diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients.

Certain prior period presentations and disclosures, while not required to be recast, were reclassified to ensure comparability with current period classifications.
COVID-19 Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in governmental authorities taking measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity in certain jurisdictions, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact BlackRock’s business. While global markets have significantly recovered since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen. BlackRock is actively monitoring COVID-19 developments and their potential impact on the Company’s employees, business and operations, particularly in jurisdictions where BlackRock has significant employee populations and/or business activity.
The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and the related impact on the global economy, affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the shifting epicenter, and emergence of new variants, of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, the availability, adoption and the efficacy of treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees. See Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of this filing for further information on the possible future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
United Kingdom Exit from European Union
On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“UK”) and the European Union (“EU”) reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. The UK and the EU concluded a free trade agreement, known as the “EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement”. The agreement does not include any substantive provisions governing cross-border trade in financial services between the UK and the EU. The UK and the EU have also concluded a memorandum of understanding governing aspects of the relationship between the jurisdictions' regulators with respect to financial services, but this has not yet been ratified or published. As a result, since January 1, 2021, cross-border financial services trade between the UK and the EU has been governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock has implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which are and have been time consuming and costly and may add complexity to BlackRock’s future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regard to delegation and outsourcing, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Acquisition
On February 1, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Aperio Group, LLC (the “Aperio Transaction” or “Aperio”), a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts (“SMAs”) for approximately $1.1 billion in cash, using existing cash resources. The acquisition of Aperio increased BlackRock’s SMA assets under management and expanded the breadth of the Company’s capabilities via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance preferences across all asset classes.

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2021 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020
GAAP. Operating income of $1,545 million increased $861 million and operating margin of 35.1% increased 1,670 bps from the first quarter of 2020. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected the impact of $589 million related to the previously reported charitable contribution of BlackRock’s remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “Charitable Contribution”) in the first quarter of 2020. Operating income and operating margin also reflected higher investment advisory and administration fees, performance fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits expense and higher product launch costs in 2021, including the impact of $178 million associated with the March 2021 close of the $4.9 billion BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) decreased $136 million from the first quarter of 2020, reflecting the impact of a pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital Network, Inc. (“iCapital”) and $122 million pre-tax gain related to the Charitable Contribution in the first quarter of 2020. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI also included higher mark-to-market gains on the Company’s co-investment portfolio, largely offset by the revaluation of certain minority investments in the first quarter of 2021.
First quarter 2021 and 2020 income tax expense (benefit) reflected $39 million and $64 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. Income tax benefit for the first quarter of 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $2.62, or 51%, from the first quarter of 2020, reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution incurred in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in earnings per diluted common share also included higher revenue and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by higher product launch costs, lower nonoperating income, and a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,545 million increased $272 million and operating margin of 44.4% increased 270 bps from the first quarter of 2020. Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.17, or 18%, from the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher operating income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by lower nonoperating income and a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from as adjusted results for the first quarter of 2020.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, included a non-GAAP expense adjustment during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Charitable Contribution expense of $589 million has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $122 million related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, for information on the Charitable Contribution.
The three months ended March 31, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the non-recurring nature of the Charitable Contribution.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.
(4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. At March 31, 2021, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(3)
Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing four months.
(4)
Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Approximately $4.1 billion of ETFs AUM held in advisory accounts associated with the FRBNY assignment as of March 31, 2021 (disclosed via FRBNY reporting as of April 12, 2021) are included within Fixed Income ETFs AUM or Fixed Income AUM above. These holdings are excluded from Advisory AUM.
(5)
Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM increased $330.7 billion to $9.01 trillion at March 31, 2021, driven by positive net inflows, net market appreciation and AUM acquired in the Aperio Transaction, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $132.6 billion included $68.5 billion, $36.5 billion and $27.6 billion of net inflows into ETFs, retail and institutional products, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $68.5 billion reflected continued growth in core equity and sustainable ETFs and inflows into precision exposures. Net inflows were positive across all asset classes, led by equity net inflows of $66.4 billion. By region, ETFs inflows were diversified with $44.6 billion of net inflows in US-listed ETFs and $19 billion of net inflows in European-listed ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $36.5 billion were positive in both the US and internationally, and across all major asset classes. Flows were led by fixed income and equity net inflows of $14.8 billion and $14.3 billion, respectively.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $16.5 billion reflected continued growth in LifePath® target-date funds and alternatives.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $11.1 billion were primarily led by fixed income net inflows of $42.2 billion, partially offset by equity net outflows of $31.4 billion.
Cash management AUM increased to $703.9 billion, driven by net inflows of $39.2 billion.
Net market appreciation of $164.7 billion was primarily driven by global equity market appreciation, partially offset by fixed income market declines.
AUM decreased $46.9 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Euro and the Japanese yen.

Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Approximately $4.1 billion of ETFs AUM held in advisory accounts associated with the FRBNY assignment as of March 31, 2021 (disclosed via FRBNY reporting as of April 12, 2021) are included within Fixed Income ETFs AUM or Fixed Income AUM above. These holdings are excluded from Advisory AUM.
(5)
Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM increased $2.54 trillion to $9.01 trillion at March 31, 2021, driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows, the positive impact of foreign exchange movements and AUM acquired in the Aperio Transaction.
Long-term net inflows of $408.6 billion were comprised of net inflows of $239.5 billion, $107.6 billion and $61.5 billion from ETFs, retail and institutional clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $239.5 billion reflected positive flows across core equity, strategic and precision ETFs, and across asset classes. Equity net inflows of $132.3 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $92.1 billion were led by flows into investment grade corporate bonds, high yield, treasuries and core bond ETFs. By region, ETFs inflows were diversified with $149.4 billion of net inflows in US-listed ETFs and $78.5 billion of net inflows in European-listed ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $107.6 billion primarily reflected net inflows of $49 billion and $58.6 billion in the US and internationally, respectively. Retail net inflows reflected strength in thematic and global equity funds, global and US core fixed income funds, and alternative funds.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $50 billion primarily reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, active fixed income strategies and illiquid alternatives.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $11.5 billion were primarily driven by fixed income net inflows of $93.3 billion, partially offset by $82.5 billion of net outflows from equity, as clients re-balanced portfolios after significant equity market gains or sought to immunize portfolios though Liability Driven Investment strategies.
Cash management AUM increased to $703.9 billion, driven by net inflows of $100.1 billion.
Net market appreciation of $1.82 trillion was driven primarily by global equity market appreciation.
AUM increased $154.4 billion due to the positive impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound, the Euro and the Canadian dollar.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2020
Revenue increased $688 million, or 19%, from the three months ended March 31, 2020, reflecting higher base and performance fees and 12% growth in technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3,592 million increased $537 million from $3,055 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and organic growth, partially offset by the impact of yield-related fee waivers on certain money market funds and strategic pricing changes to certain products, lower securities lending revenue, and the effect of one less day in the quarter. Securities lending revenue of $127 million decreased from $158 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily reflecting lower spreads, partially offset by higher average balances of securities on loan.
Investment advisory performance fees of $129 million increased $88 million from $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenue from liquid alternative and long-only products.
Technology services revenue of $306 million increased $32 million from $274 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin.
Advisory and other revenue of $31 million decreased $33 million from $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution and lower transition management assignments.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2020
Expense decreased $173 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely driven by lower general and administration expense, reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution in the first quarter of 2020. Expense also reflected higher product launch costs, higher employee compensation and benefits expense and higher volume-related expense in the first quarter of 2021.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $272 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income and higher performance fees, and the higher mark-to-market impact of certain deferred compensation programs.
Direct fund expense increased $43 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily reflecting higher average AUM.
General and administration expense decreased $557 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely driven by the Charitable Contribution in the year ago quarter. General and administration expense also reflected higher product launch costs, and higher portfolio services and technology expense, offset by lower marketing and promotional expense and contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and the impact of costs related to certain legal matters incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2020.
Amortization of intangible assets expense increased $9 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to the Aperio Transaction.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”), (collectively, “consolidated sponsored investment products”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2020 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment products to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 included $242 million and $206 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment products (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended March 31, 2021).
Accounts receivable at March 31, 2021 increased $290 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher base and performance fee receivables. Investments, including the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, increased $226 million from December 31, 2020 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $1,050 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Aperio Transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment) increased $752 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities).
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at March 31, 2021 decreased $1,422 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to 2020 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by 2021 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at March 31, 2021 increased $168 million from December 31, 2020, including the impact of fund launch costs in the current quarter. Other liabilities increased $902 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets) and higher other liabilities of consolidated sponsored investment products. Net deferred income tax liabilities at March 31, 2021 increased $121 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Aperio Transaction and the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $7,145 million and $6,919 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the consolidated sponsored investment products. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $1.1 billion and primarily reflected $1.1 billion of cash outflows related to the Aperio Transaction, $48 million of purchases of property and equipment and $36 million of net investment purchases, partially offset by $34 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $1.2 billion, primarily resulting from $661 million of cash dividend payments and $568 million of share repurchases, including $300 million in open market transactions and $268 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were as follows:

(2)
The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
Total liquidity resources decreased $2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2020 year-end incentive awards, approximately $1.1 billion of cash outflow related to the Aperio Transaction, cash dividend payments of $661 million and share repurchases of $568 million, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities and a $400 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount of the credit facility.
A significant portion of the Company’s $4,597 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
The Company’s liquidity and capital resources were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions during the three months ended March 31, 2021. The Company will continue to monitor its liquidity and capital resources due to the current pandemic.
Share Repurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 0.4 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $300 million. At March 31, 2021, there were 4.6 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2021 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2021, the Company’s credit facility was amended to increase the aggregate commitment amount to $4.4 billion and to extend the maturity date to March 2026 (the “2021 credit facility”). In addition, the amendment incorporated certain sustainability-linked pricing metrics into the agreement. Specifically, the Company’s applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments on an annual basis if the Company achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, or an applicable replacement benchmark, plus a spread. The 2021 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2021 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.4 billion. The 2021 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at March 31, 2021. The 2021 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At March 31, 2021, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2021 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2021 credit facility. At March 31, 2021, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At March 31, 2021, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $7.3 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2020 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company paid approximately $41 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at March 31, 2021 were as follows:

The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of March 31, 2021.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At March 31, 2021, the Company had $841 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated sponsored investment products. These products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue from acquired contracts. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at March 31, 2021 totaled $21 million and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of March 31, 2021 and subject to this type of indemnification was $292 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $312 billion were held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at March 31, 2021. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at March 31, 2021.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2020 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had $748 million and $584 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 16, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in BlackRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, BlackRock’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks.
RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect BlackRock’s business, operations and financial condition which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and may adversely affect BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in governmental authorities taking measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity in certain jurisdictions, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact BlackRock’s business. While global markets have significantly recovered since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of BlackRock’s investment portfolio, including its coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and BlackRock’s ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on BlackRock’s clients, and key vendors (such as pricing providers), market participants and other third-parties with whom it does business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin and/or BlackRock’s other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity and fraud risks;
•
the possibility that prolonged periods away from physical office locations and daily in-person interactions with colleagues may cause members of BlackRock’s workforce to become disconnected with corporate culture and policies, which may increase operational issues arising from human error and/or individual attempts to circumvent controls due to distractions, fatigue or a lack of oversight; and
•
the disruption to BlackRock’s workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations of its remote work environment (including any complications associated with hiring and onboarding new employees remotely), and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and the related impact on the global economy, affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the shifting epicenter, and emergence of new variants, of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the other risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in BlackRock’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",1273.0,,0.0,12:59:42,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRock’s future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as “trend,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “pipeline,” “believe,” “comfortable,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “current,” “intention,” “estimate,” “position,” “assume,” “outlook,” “continue,” “remain,” “maintain,” “sustain,” “seek,” “achieve,” and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may” and similar expressions.
BlackRock cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance.
BlackRock has previously disclosed risk factors in its Securities and Exchange Commission reports. These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this report, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance and include: (1) a pandemic or health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and its continued impact on financial institutions, the global economy or capital markets, as well as BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees, and BlackRock’s results of operations, the full extent of which may be unknown; (2) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (3) changes and volatility in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management (“AUM”); (4) the relative and absolute investment performance of BlackRock’s investment products; (5) BlackRock’s ability to develop new products and services that address client preferences; (6) the impact of increased competition; (7) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (8) BlackRock’s ability to integrate acquired businesses successfully; (9) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (10) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (11) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property, information and cyber security protection; (12) attempts to circumvent BlackRock’s operational control environment or the potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems; (13) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to BlackRock; (14) changes in law and policy and uncertainty pending any such changes; (15) any failure to effectively manage conflicts of interest; (16) damage to BlackRock’s reputation; (17) terrorist activities, civil unrest, international hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries or BlackRock; (18) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (19) fluctuations in the carrying value of BlackRock’s economic investments; (20) the impact of changes to tax legislation, including income, payroll and transaction taxes, and taxation on products or transactions, which could affect the value proposition to clients and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (21) BlackRock’s success in negotiating distribution arrangements and maintaining distribution channels for its products; (22) the failure by a key vendor of BlackRock to fulfill its obligations to the Company; (23) operational, technological and regulatory risks associated with BlackRock’s major technology partnerships; (24) any disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds (“ETF”) platform; (25) the impact of BlackRock electing to provide support to its products from time to time and any potential liabilities related to securities lending or other indemnification obligations; and (26) the impact of problems at other financial institutions or the failure or negative performance of products at other financial institutions.
OVERVIEW

(together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $9.5 trillion of AUM at June 30, 2021.

COVID-19 Impact
BlackRock continues to actively monitor COVID-19 developments and their potential impact on the Company’s employees, business and operations, particularly in jurisdictions where BlackRock has significant employee populations and/or business activity.
The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and existing and new variants of COVID-19, affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the emergence and spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, and the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines. See Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of this filing for further information on the possible future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
United Kingdom Exit from European Union
On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“UK”) and the European Union (“EU”) reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. The UK and the EU concluded a free trade agreement, known as the “EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.” The agreement does not include any substantive provisions governing cross-border trade in financial services between the UK and the EU. As a result, since January 1, 2021, cross-border financial services trade between the UK and the EU has been governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which may add complexity to BlackRock’s future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regard to delegation and outsourcing, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Acquisition
On February 1, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Aperio Group, LLC (the “Aperio Transaction” or “Aperio”), a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts (“SMAs”) for approximately $1.1 billion in cash, using existing cash resources. The acquisition of Aperio increased BlackRock’s SMA assets under management and expanded the breadth of the Company’s capabilities via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance preferences across all asset classes.

THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
GAAP. Operating income of $1,931 million increased $525 million and operating margin of 40.1% increased 160 bps from the second quarter of 2020. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected significant market gains as well as strong organic growth, higher performance fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher expense, including higher employee compensation and benefits, higher volume-related expense and higher general and administration expense. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) decreased $68 million from the second quarter of 2020, reflecting lower mark-to-market gains on the Company’s un-hedged seed capital portfolios and certain minority investments, partially offset by higher mark-to-market gains on the Company’s private equity co-investment portfolio.
Second quarter 2021 income tax expense included $171 million of noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.07, or 14%, from the second quarter of 2020, reflecting higher operating income, partially offset by lower nonoperating income and a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,931 million increased $525 million and operating margin of 44.9% increased 120 bps from the second quarter of 2020. Earnings per diluted common share increased $2.18, or 28%, from the second quarter of 2020. The noncash net tax expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities described above has been excluded from as adjusted results.
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 COMPARED WITH SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
GAAP. Operating income of $3,476 million increased $1,386 million and operating margin of 37.7% increased 930 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2020. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected the impact of $589 million related to the previously reported charitable contribution of BlackRock’s remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “Charitable Contribution”) during the six months ended June 30, 2020. Operating income and operating margin also reflected higher investment advisory and administration fees (collectively “base fees”), performance fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits expense and higher product launch costs in 2021, including the impact of $178 million associated with the March 2021 close of the $4.9 billion BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI decreased $204 million from the six months ended June 30, 2020, reflecting the impact of a pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital Network, Inc. (“iCapital”) and $122 million pre-tax gain related to the Charitable Contribution during the six months ended June 30, 2020, partially offset by mark-to-market gains on the Company’s co-investment and un-hedged seed capital portfolios during the six months ended June 30, 2021.
Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 reflected the $171 million noncash net expense described above. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 also reflected $39 million and $66 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of each year. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $3.70, or 28%, from the six months ended June 30, 2020, reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in earnings per diluted common share also included higher revenue, partially offset by higher product launch costs, lower nonoperating income, and a higher effective tax rate in the six months ended June 30, 2021.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $3,476 million increased $797 million and operating margin of 44.7% increased 200 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2020. Earnings per diluted common share increased $3.36, or 23%, from the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to higher operating income, partially offset by lower nonoperating income and a higher effective tax rate in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 excluded the $171 million noncash net expense described above. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from as adjusted results for the six months ended June 30, 2020.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, includes a non-GAAP expense adjustment during the six months ended June 30, 2020. The Charitable Contribution expense of $589 million has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $122 million related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, for information on the Charitable Contribution.
The six months ended June 30, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million that was recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the Charitable Contribution. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Approximately $2.2 billion of ETFs AUM held in advisory accounts associated with the FRBNY assignment as of June 30, 2021 (disclosed via FRBNY reporting as of July 13, 2021) are included within Fixed Income ETFs AUM or Fixed Income AUM above.

Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM increased $488.6 billion to $9.5 trillion at June 30, 2021, driven by net market appreciation and positive net inflows.
Long-term net inflows of $59.7 billion were comprised of net inflows of $75.1 billion and $21.4 billion into ETFs and retail, respectively, partially offset by net outflows $36.8 billion from institutional clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $75.1 billion reflected continued growth in core equity and sustainable ETFs, as well as inflows into precision exposures and renewed strength in fixed income ETFs. Net inflows were positive across all asset classes and were led by equity and fixed income. Equity net inflows of $51.4 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $21.7 billion were led by flows into core, inflation linked, emerging market and municipal bond ETFs. By region, ETFs inflows were diversified with $45.8 billion of net inflows in US-listed ETFs and $25.9 billion of net inflows in European-listed ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $21.4 billion were positive in both the US and internationally, and across all major asset classes. Equity net inflows of $9.9 billion reflected strength in global and thematic equity funds, and fixed income net inflows of $6.7 billion were driven by global and US core fixed income funds. Retail alternatives net inflows of $4.0 billion were led by event-driven and systematic multi-strategy funds.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $43.5 billion were led by $35.1 billion of multi-asset net inflows largely driven by a significant Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (“OCIO”) mandate from a UK pension client. Net inflows also reflected continued growth in LifePath® target-date funds and alternatives.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $80.3 billion included the full impact of a $58 billion low-fee institutional index redemption from a large US public pension client.
Cash management AUM increased to $727.6 billion, driven by net inflows of $23.3 billion.
Net market appreciation of $399.4 billion was primarily driven by global equity and fixed income market appreciation.
AUM increased $8.3 billion due to the positive impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the Euro and the Canadian dollar.

Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Approximately $2.2 billion of ETFs AUM held in advisory accounts associated with the FRBNY assignment as of June 30, 2021 (disclosed via FRBNY reporting as of July 13, 2021) are included within Fixed Income ETFs AUM or Fixed Income AUM above. These holdings are excluded from Advisory AUM.
(5)
Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM increased $819.3 billion to $9.5 trillion at June 30, 2021, driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows, and AUM acquired in the Aperio Transaction, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $192.3 billion were comprised of net inflows of $143.6 billion and $57.9 billion into ETFs and retail, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $9.2 billion from institutional clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $143.6 billion reflected positive flows across core equity, strategic and precision ETFs, and across asset classes. Equity net inflows of $117.8 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $23.3 billion were led by flows into investment grade corporate bonds, high yield, treasuries and core bond ETFs. By region, ETFs inflows were diversified with $90.3 billion of net inflows in US-listed ETFs and $44.9 billion of net inflows in European-listed ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $57.9 billion primarily reflected net inflows of $33.4 billion and $24.5 billion in the US and internationally, respectively. Retail net inflows reflected strength in thematic and global equity funds, global and US core fixed income funds, and alternatives funds.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $60 billion included the previously discussed impact of a significant OCIO mandate from a UK pension client, and also reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, active fixed income strategies and illiquid alternatives.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $69.2 billion included the previously discussed impact of a $58 billion low-fee institutional index redemption. Equity net outflows of $115.1 billion were partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $46 billion.
Cash management AUM increased to $727.6 billion, driven by net inflows of $62.5 billion.
Net market appreciation of $564 billion was driven primarily by global equity market appreciation, partially offset by fixed income market declines.
AUM decreased $38.6 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Japanese yen and the Euro.

AUM increased $2.18 trillion to $9.5 trillion at June 30, 2021, driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows, the positive impact of foreign exchange movements and AUM acquired in the Aperio Transaction.
Long-term net inflows of $406.1 billion were comprised of net inflows of $263.7 billion, $112.8 billion and $29.6 billion from ETFs, retail and institutional clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $263.7 billion reflected positive flows across core equity, strategic and precision ETFs, and across asset classes. Equity net inflows of $197.9 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $56.5 billion were led by flows into investment grade corporate bonds, high yield, treasuries and core bond ETFs. By region, ETFs net inflows were diversified with $166.7 billion of net inflows in US-listed ETFs and $83.1 billion of net inflows in European-listed ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $112.8 billion included net inflows of $51.1 billion and $61.7 billion in the US and internationally, respectively. Retail net inflows reflected strength in thematic and global equity funds, global and US core fixed income funds, and alternatives funds.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $91 billion included the previously discussed impact of a significant OCIO mandate from a UK pension client, and also reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, active fixed income strategies and illiquid alternatives.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $61.4 billion included the previously discussed impact of a $58 billion low-fee institutional index redemption. Equity net outflows of $169.2 billion were partially offset fixed income net inflows of $107.8 billion.
Cash management AUM increased to $727.6 billion, driven by net inflows of $99.2 billion.
Net market appreciation of $1.49 trillion was driven primarily by global equity market appreciation.
AUM increased $136.3 billion due to the positive impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound and the Euro.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2020
Revenue increased $1,172 million, or 32%, from the three months ended June 30, 2020, reflecting significant market gains as well as strong organic growth, higher performance fees and 14% growth in technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3,757 million increased $791 million from $2,966 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by the impact of yield-related fee waivers on certain money market funds and strategic pricing changes to certain products, and lower securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $140 million decreased $70 million from $210 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, primarily reflecting lower spreads, partially offset by higher average balances of securities on loan.
Investment advisory performance fees of $340 million increased $228 million from $112 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenue from liquid and illiquid alternative products.

Revenue increased $1,860 million, or 25%, from the six months ended June 30, 2020, reflecting higher base and performance fees and higher technology services revenue, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $7,349 million increased $1,328 million from $6,021 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and organic growth, partially offset by the impact of yield-related fee waivers on certain money market funds and strategic pricing changes to certain products, and lower securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $267 million decreased $101 million from $368 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily reflecting lower spreads, partially offset by higher average balances of securities on loan.
Investment advisory performance fees of $469 million increased $316 million from $153 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenue from liquid and illiquid alternative and long-only products.

2021. Income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 included $171 million noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021, also reflected $39 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2021.
The as adjusted effective tax rate of 23.8% and 22.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, excluded the $171 million noncash deferred tax revaluation noncash expense mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
2020. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2020, included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution and $66 million of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2020.
The as adjusted effective tax rate of 20.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 excluded the $241 million discrete tax benefit in connection with the Charitable Contribution due to its nonrecurring nature.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products (“CIPs”).
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”), (collectively, “consolidated sponsored investment products” or “CIPs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2020 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 included $280 million and $206 million, respectively, of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended June 30, 2021).
Accounts receivable at June 30, 2021 increased $255 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher base and performance fee receivables. Investments, including the impact of CIPs, increased $676 million from December 31, 2020 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $1,062 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Aperio Transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including property and equipment) increased $1,363 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities) and an increase in current taxes receivable.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at June 30, 2021 decreased $795 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to 2020 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by 2021 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at June 30, 2021 decreased $210 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased accruals. Other liabilities increased $1,498 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets) and higher other liabilities of CIPs. Net deferred income tax liabilities at June 30, 2021 increased $234 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Aperio Transaction and the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation and the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the UK.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $7,595 million and $6,919 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Investments include consolidated investments held by CIPs accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact CIPs, for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were $1.4 billion and primarily reflected $1.1 billion of cash outflows related to the Aperio Transaction, $178 million of purchases of property and equipment and $176 million of net investment purchases, partially offset by $55 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were $2.8 billion, primarily resulting from $1.3 billion of cash dividend payments and $873 million of share repurchases, including $600 million in open market transactions and $273 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $750 million of repayments of long-term borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were as follows:

(2)
The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
Total liquidity resources decreased $1.9 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2020 year-end incentive awards, cash dividend payments of $1.3 billion, approximately $1.1 billion of cash outflow related to the Aperio Transaction, share repurchases of $873 million and repayments of borrowings of $750 million, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities and a $400 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount of the credit facility.
A significant portion of the Company’s $5,287 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company repurchased 0.8 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $600 million. At June 30, 2021, there were 4.3 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2021 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2021, the Company’s credit facility was amended to increase the aggregate commitment amount to $4.4 billion and to extend the maturity date to March 2026 (the “2021 credit facility”). In addition, the amendment incorporated certain sustainability-linked pricing metrics into the agreement. Specifically, the Company’s applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments on an annual basis if the Company achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, or an applicable replacement benchmark, plus a spread. The 2021 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2021 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.4 billion. The 2021 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at June 30, 2021. The 2021 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At June 30, 2021, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2021 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2021 credit facility. At June 30, 2021, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At June 30, 2021, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $6.5 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2020 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company paid approximately $108 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at June 30, 2021 were as follows:

The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of June 30, 2021.
In May 2021, the Company fully repaid $750 million of 4.25% notes at maturity.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At June 30, 2021, the Company had $930 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue from acquired contracts. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at June 30, 2021 totaled $34 million and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of June 30, 2021 and subject to this type of indemnification was $297 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $316 billion were held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at June 30, 2021. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at June 30, 2021.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2020 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
In addition to sponsored investment products, the Company consolidates an affiliated entity, which it deems to be a VRE, because it can exert control over its financial and operating policies, based on the Company’s 50.1% ownership and voting rights.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had $1.1 billion and $584 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 16, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk factors previously disclosed in BlackRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020:
RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect BlackRock’s business, operations and financial condition which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact BlackRock’s business. While global markets have significantly recovered since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing and could be prolonged or worsen and have an ongoing adverse impact on BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of BlackRock’s investment portfolio, including its coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and BlackRock’s ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on BlackRock’s clients, and key vendors (such as pricing providers), market participants and other third-parties with whom it does business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin and/or BlackRock’s other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity and fraud risks;
•
the possibility that prolonged periods away from physical office locations and daily in-person interactions with colleagues may cause members of BlackRock’s workforce to become disconnected with corporate culture and policies, which may increase operational issues arising from human error and/or individual attempts to circumvent controls due to distractions, fatigue or a lack of oversight; and
•
the disruption to BlackRock’s workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations of its remote work environment (including any complications associated with hiring and onboarding new employees remotely), and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and the related impact on the global economy, affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the emergence and spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the other risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in BlackRock’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",1547.0,,0.0,13:36:35,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

BlackRock has previously disclosed risk factors in its Securities and Exchange Commission reports. These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this report, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance and include: (1) a pandemic or health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and its continued impact on financial institutions, the global economy or capital markets, as well as BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees, and BlackRock’s results of operations, the full extent of which may be unknown; (2) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (3) changes and volatility in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management (“AUM”); (4) the relative and absolute investment performance of BlackRock’s investment products; (5) BlackRock’s ability to develop new products and services that address client preferences; (6) the impact of increased competition; (7) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (8) BlackRock’s ability to integrate acquired businesses successfully; (9) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (10) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (11) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property, information and cyber security protection; (12) attempts to circumvent BlackRock’s operational control environment or the potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems; (13) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to BlackRock; (14) changes in law and policy and uncertainty pending any such changes; (15) any failure to effectively manage conflicts of interest; (16) damage to BlackRock’s reputation; (17) terrorist activities, civil unrest, international hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries or BlackRock; (18) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (19) fluctuations in the carrying value of BlackRock’s economic investments; (20) the impact of changes to tax legislation, including income, payroll and transaction taxes, and taxation on products or transactions, which could affect the value proposition to clients and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (21) BlackRock’s success in negotiating distribution arrangements and maintaining distribution channels for its products; (22) the failure by a key vendor of BlackRock to fulfill its obligations to the Company; (23) operational, technological and regulatory risks associated with BlackRock’s major technology partnerships; (24) any disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds (“ETF”) platform; (25) the impact of BlackRock electing to provide support to its products from time to time and any potential liabilities related to securities lending or other indemnification obligations; and (26) the impact of problems at other financial institutions or the failure or negative performance of products at other financial institutions.
OVERVIEW
BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $9.5 trillion of AUM at September 30, 2021. With approximately 18,000 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.
BlackRock’s diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, ETFs, separate accounts, collective trust funds and other pooled investment vehicles.

Certain prior period presentations and disclosures, while not required to be recast, were reclassified to ensure comparability with current period classifications.
COVID-19 Impact
BlackRock continues to actively monitor COVID-19 developments and their potential impact on the Company’s employees, business and operations, particularly in jurisdictions where BlackRock has significant employee populations and/or business activity.
The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and existing and new variants of COVID-19, affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the emergence and spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, and the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines. See Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of this filing for further information on the possible future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
United Kingdom Exit from European Union
On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“UK”) and the European Union (“EU”) reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. The UK and the EU concluded a free trade agreement, known as the “EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.” The agreement does not include any substantive provisions governing cross-border trade in financial services between the UK and the EU. As a result, since January 1, 2021, cross-border financial services trade between the UK and the EU has been governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which may add complexity to BlackRock’s future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regard to delegation and cross-border marketing of funds, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.
Acquisition
On February 1, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Aperio Group, LLC (the “Aperio Transaction” or “Aperio”), a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts (“SMAs”) for approximately $1.1 billion in cash, using existing cash resources. The acquisition of Aperio increased BlackRock’s SMA assets under management and expanded the breadth of the Company’s capabilities via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance preferences across all asset classes.

Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity divided by total shares outstanding at September 30 of the respective period-end.
THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020
GAAP. Operating income of $1,935 million increased $178 million and operating margin of 38.3% decreased 190 bps from the third quarter of 2020. Operating income and operating margin reflected market gains as well as strong organic growth and technology services revenue, offset by lower performance fees and higher expense, driven by higher general and administration expense, including higher transaction-related expense and product launch costs in the current quarter, higher employee compensation and benefits expense, and higher direct fund expense. Product launch costs of $99 million in the third quarter of 2021 were primarily associated with the September 2021 close of the BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Trust. Product launch costs of $83 million in the third quarter of 2020 were primarily associated with the BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust. Operating income and operating margin also reflected $11 million of noncash occupancy expense related to the lease of office space for the Company’s future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (“Lease cost - Hudson Yards”), which it expects to begin to occupy in late 2022 (and begin lease payments in May 2023).
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) increased $193 million from the third quarter of 2020, primarily driven by non-cash gains related to our strategic minority investments in iCapital Network, Inc. (“iCapital”) and Scalable Capital Limited (“Scalable”) and higher mark-to-market gains on the Company’s private equity co-investment portfolio.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $2.02, or 23%, from the third quarter of 2020, reflecting higher operating and nonoperating income, and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,946 million increased $189 million and operating margin of 45.8% decreased 120 bps from the third quarter of 2020. Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.73, or 19%, from the third quarter of 2020. The impact of the Lease cost - Hudson Yards described above has been excluded from as adjusted results for the third quarter of 2021. Income tax expense, as adjusted, for the third quarter of 2020 excluded a $54 million noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate.
NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021 COMPARED WITH NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020
GAAP. Operating income of $5,411 million increased $1,564 million and operating margin of 37.9% increased 510 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected the impact of $589 million related to the previously reported charitable contribution of BlackRock’s remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “Charitable Contribution”) during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Operating income and operating margin also reflected higher investment advisory and administration fees (collectively “base fees”), performance fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits expense, higher volume-related expense and higher product launch costs in 2021.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI decreased $11 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, reflecting the impact of a pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital and $122 million pre-tax gain related to the Charitable Contribution during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, partially offset by the impact of non-cash gains related to iCapital and Scalable and higher mark-to-market gains on the Company’s private equity co-investment portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected the $171 million noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution and a $54 million noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities described above. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 also reflected $42 million and $78 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of each year. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $5.75, or 26%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in earnings per diluted common share also included higher revenue, partially offset by higher product launch costs, lower nonoperating income, and a higher effective tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $5,422 million increased $986 million and operating margin of 45.1% increased 80 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Earnings per diluted common share increased $5.11, or 22%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to higher operating and nonoperating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 excluded the $171 million and $54 million, respectively, of noncash net expense described above. The financial impact related to the Lease cost - Hudson Yards and the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from as adjusted results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded expense of $11 million related to the Lease cost - Hudson Yards. While the Company expects to begin to occupy the new office space in late 2022 (and begin cash lease payments in May 2023), the Company is required to record lease expense from August 2021 because it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. As a result, the Company is recognizing lease expense for both its current and future headquarters until its current headquarters lease expires in April 2023. Management believes removing the Lease cost - Hudson Yards when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess its financial performance and enhances comparability among periods presented. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Charitable Contribution expense of $589 million has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $122 million related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, for information on the Lease cost - Hudson Yards and Charitable Contribution.
The nine months ended September 30, 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million that was recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the Charitable Contribution. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM remained flat at $9.5 trillion at September 30, 2021, as positive net inflows were more than offset by net market depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $98 billion were comprised of net inflows of $58 billion, $23 billion and $17 billion into ETFs, retail and institutional, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $58 billion reflected continued growth in core equity, fixed income and sustainable ETFs, as well as inflows into precision exposures. Equity net inflows of $35 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $22 billion reflected demand for inflation-protection and municipal bond ETFs. By region, ETFs inflows were diversified with $34 billion of net inflows in US-listed ETFs and $19 billion of net inflows in European-listed ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $23 billion were positive in both the US and internationally, and across all major asset classes. Equity net inflows of $10 billion reflected strength in global and thematic equity funds, and fixed income net inflows of $5 billion were driven by unconstrained, high yield and municipal fixed income funds. Retail multi-asset net inflows of $5 billion included $2 billion from the successful launch of our first ESG-oriented closed-end fund in September, the BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Trust.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $26 billion were led by $26 billion of multi-asset net inflows and included the impact of a significant Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (“OCIO”) mandate from an Asia-Pacific client. Net inflows also reflected continued growth in LifePath® target-date funds.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $8 billion reflected equity net outflows, which were partially offset by fixed income net inflows, as clients continued to re-balance portfolios after significant equity market gains or sought to immunize portfolios though LDI strategies.
Cash management AUM decreased to $712 billion, driven by net outflows of $12 billion.
Net market depreciation of $56 billion was primarily driven by global equity market depreciation.
AUM decreased $52 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound and the Euro.

AUM increased $787 billion to $9.5 trillion at September 30, 2021, driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows, and AUM acquired in the Aperio Transaction, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $290 billion were comprised of net inflows of $202 billion, $81 billion and $8 billion into ETFs, retail and institutional, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $202 billion reflected positive flows across core equity, strategic and precision ETFs, and across asset classes. Equity net inflows of $153 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $46 billion were led by flows into inflation-protected, emerging market, municipal and core bond ETFs. By region, ETFs inflows were diversified with $125 billion of net inflows in US-listed ETFs and $64 billion of net inflows in European-listed ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $81 billion primarily reflected net inflows of $46 billion and $34 billion in the US and internationally, respectively. Retail net inflows reflected strength in thematic and US growth equity funds, unconstrained, municipal and total return fixed income funds, multi-asset and alternatives funds.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $86 billion included the previously disclosed impact of a significant OCIO mandate from a UK pension client in the second quarter of 2021 and a more recent significant OCIO mandate from an Asia-Pacific client, and also reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, active fixed income strategies and illiquid alternatives.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $77 billion included the previously disclosed impact of a $58 billion low-fee institutional index redemption in the second quarter of 2021. Equity net outflows of $129 billion were partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $52 billion.
Cash management AUM increased to $712 billion, driven by net inflows of $50 billion.
Net market appreciation of $508 billion was driven primarily by global equity market appreciation.
AUM decreased $91 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Euro and the Japanese yen.

AUM increased $1.7 trillion to $9.5 trillion at September 30, 2021, driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows, the positive impact of foreign exchange movements and AUM acquired in the Aperio Transaction.
Long-term net inflows of $407 billion were comprised of net inflows of $280 billion, $116 billion and $10 billion from ETFs, retail and institutional, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $280 billion reflected positive flows across core equity, strategic and precision ETFs, and across asset classes. Equity net inflows of $218 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $59 billion were led by flows into inflation-protected, emerging market, municipal and core bond ETFs. By region, ETFs net inflows were diversified with $173 billion of net inflows in US-listed ETFs and $91 billion of net inflows in European-listed ETFs.
•
Retail net inflows of $116 billion included net inflows of $56 billion and $60 billion in the US and internationally, respectively. Retail net inflows reflected strength in thematic and US growth equity funds, unconstrained, municipal and total return fixed income funds, multi-asset and alternatives funds.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $87 billion included the previously disclosed impact of a significant OCIO mandate from a UK pension client in the second quarter of 2021 and a more recent significant OCIO mandate from an Asia-Pacific client, and also reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, active fixed income strategies and illiquid alternatives.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $77 billion included the previously discussed impact of a $58 billion low-fee institutional index redemption in the second quarter of 2021. Equity net outflows of $159 billion were partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $83 billion.
Cash management AUM increased to $712 billion, driven by net inflows of $59 billion.
Net market appreciation of $1.1 trillion was driven by global equity market appreciation.
AUM increased $11 billion due to the positive impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound and the Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the Japanese yen and the Euro.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2020
Revenue increased $681 million, or 16%, from the three months ended September 30, 2020, reflecting market gains as well as strong organic growth and 13% growth in technology services revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3,943 million increased $718 million from $3,225 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by the impact of yield-related fee waivers on certain money market funds and strategic pricing changes to certain products. Securities lending revenue of $152 million decreased from $153 million in the third quarter of 2020, primarily reflecting lower asset spreads, partially offset by higher average balances of securities on loan.
Investment advisory performance fees of $345 million decreased $187 million from $532 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative products, including lower fees from a single hedge fund strategy with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter, partially offset by higher revenue from illiquid alternative products.
Technology services revenue of $320 million increased $38 million from $282 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020
Revenue increased $2,541 million, or 22%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2020, reflecting higher base and performance fees and higher technology services revenue, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $11,292 million increased $2,046 million from $9,246 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and organic growth, partially offset by the impact of yield-related fee waivers on certain money market funds and strategic pricing changes to certain products, and lower securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $419 million decreased $102 million from $521 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily reflecting lower spreads, partially offset by higher average balances of securities on loan.
Investment advisory performance fees of $814 million increased $129 million from $685 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenue from illiquid alternative and long-only products.
Technology services revenue of $942 million increased $108 million from $834 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin.
Advisory and other revenue of $110 million decreased $35 million from $145 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution, lower earnings from a strategic minority investment and lower fees from advisory assignments.

2021. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included $171 million noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, also reflected $42 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2021.
The as adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, excluded the impact of $171 million noncash deferred tax revaluation expense mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
2020. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution and $78 million of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2020.
The three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 income tax expense also included the previously described $54 million noncash net expense related to legislation enacted in the UK.
The as adjusted effective tax rate of 22.5% and 21.4% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 excluded the impact of the $54 million noncash deferred tax revaluation noncash expense mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
The as adjusted effective tax rate of 21.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 also excluded the $241 million discrete tax benefit in connection with the Charitable Contribution due to its nonrecurring nature.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products (“CIPs”).
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”), (collectively, “consolidated sponsored investment products” or “CIPs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2020 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 included $265 million and $206 million, respectively, of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended September 30, 2021).
Accounts receivable at September 30, 2021 increased $480 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher base and performance fee receivables. Investments, including the impact of CIPs, increased $182 million from December 31, 2020 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $1,022 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Aperio Transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets at September 30, 2021 increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2020 (substantially offset by an increase in operating lease liabilities), primarily related to the previously described lease of office space for the Company’s future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York. While the Company expects to begin to occupy the new office space in late 2022 (and begin cash lease payments in May 2023), the Company is required to record an operating ROU asset and related operating lease liability from August 2021 because it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. Other assets (including property and equipment) increased $1,433 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), an increase in current taxes receivable and an increase in strategic minority investments.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at September 30, 2021 decreased $156 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to 2020 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by 2021 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at September 30, 2021 increased $374 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased accruals. Operating lease liabilities at September 30, 2021 increased $1,191 million from December 31, 2020 (substantially offset by an increase in ROU assets), primarily related to the lease of office space for the Company’s future headquarters described above. Other liabilities increased $1,648 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets) and higher other liabilities of CIPs, including deferred carried interest liabilities. Net deferred income tax liabilities at September 30, 2021 decreased $14 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with capitalized costs, partially offset by the Aperio Transaction, revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the UK and investment income.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $7,101 million and $6,919 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Investments include consolidated investments held by CIPs accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact CIPs, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were $1.5 billion and primarily reflected $1.1 billion of cash outflows related to the Aperio Transaction, $285 million of net investment purchases and $215 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $77 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were $3.8 billion, primarily resulting from $1.9 billion of cash dividend payments and $1.2 billion of share repurchases, including $900 million in open market transactions and $282 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $750 million of repayments of long-term borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were as follows:

(2)
The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
Total liquidity resources decreased $962 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2020 year-end incentive awards, cash dividend payments of $1.9 billion, share repurchases of $1.2 billion, approximately $1.1 billion of cash outflow related to the Aperio Transaction and repayments of borrowings of $750 million, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities and a $400 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount of the credit facility.
A significant portion of the Company’s $5,552 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company repurchased 1.1 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $900 million. At September 30, 2021, there were 3.9 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2021 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2021, the Company’s credit facility was amended to increase the aggregate commitment amount to $4.4 billion and to extend the maturity date to March 2026 (the “2021 credit facility”). In addition, the amendment incorporated certain sustainability-linked pricing metrics into the agreement. Specifically, the Company’s applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments on an annual basis if the Company achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, or an applicable replacement benchmark, plus a spread. The 2021 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2021 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.4 billion. The 2021 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at September 30, 2021. The 2021 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At September 30, 2021, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2021 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2021 credit facility. At September 30, 2021, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At September 30, 2021, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $6.5 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2020 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company paid approximately $148 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at September 30, 2021 were as follows:

The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of September 30, 2021.
In May 2021, the Company fully repaid $750 million of 4.25% notes at maturity.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At September 30, 2021, the Company had $905 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue from acquired contracts. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at September 30, 2021 totaled $62 million and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of September 30, 2021 and subject to this type of indemnification was $279 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $299 billion were held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at September 30, 2021. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at September 30, 2021.
While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2020 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
In addition to sponsored investment products, the Company consolidates an affiliated entity, which it deems to be a VRE, because it can exert control over its financial and operating policies, based on the Company’s 50.1% ownership and voting rights.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had $1.3 billion and $584 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 16, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk factors previously disclosed in BlackRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020:
RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect BlackRock’s business, operations and financial condition which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020, the pandemic began to impact BlackRock’s business. While global markets have significantly recovered since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing and could be prolonged or worsen and have an ongoing adverse impact on BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of BlackRock’s investment portfolio, including its coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and BlackRock’s ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as some clients continue to work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on BlackRock’s clients, and key vendors (such as pricing providers), market participants and other third-parties with whom it does business;
•
the negative operational effects of extended remote working environments and the introduction of hybrid working models, including strain on Aladdin and/or BlackRock’s other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity and fraud risks;
•
the possibility that continued periods away from physical office locations and daily in-person interactions with colleagues has caused, and may cause, members of BlackRock’s workforce to become disconnected with corporate culture and policies, which may increase operational issues due to distractions, fatigue or a lack of oversight; and
•
the disruption to BlackRock’s workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations of remote and hybrid work environments (including any complications associated with hiring and onboarding new employees remotely), and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and the related impact on the global economy, affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the emergence and spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the other risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in BlackRock’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",1753.0,,0.0,13:55:20,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

With approximately 18,400 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.
BlackRock’s diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® and BlackRock exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), separate accounts, collective trust funds and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin®, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, and Cachematrix, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients. The Company is highly regulated and manages its clients’ assets as a fiduciary. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.
BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management and technology service relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through third-party distribution relationships, including financial professionals and pension consultants.
BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over 85% of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors.
Management seeks to deliver value for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on BlackRock’s differentiated competitive position, including:
•
the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for index products;
•
the Company’s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 50% of employees outside the United States serving clients locally and supporting local investment capabilities. Approximately 40% of total AUM is managed for clients domiciled outside the United States;
•
the Company’s breadth of investment strategies, including market-cap weighted index, factors, systematic active, traditional fundamental active, high conviction alpha and illiquid alternative product offerings, which enhance its ability to tailor whole-portfolio investment solutions to address specific client needs;
•
the Company’s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and macro trends including the secular shift to index investing and ETFs, growing allocations to private markets, demand for high-performing active strategies, increasing demand for sustainable investment strategies and whole portfolio solutions using index, active and illiquid alternatives products; and a continued focus on income and retirement; and
•
the Company’s longstanding commitment to innovation, technology services and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock technology products and solutions, including Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Aladdin Climate, and Cachematrix. This commitment is further extended by minority investments in distribution technologies, data and whole portfolio capabilities including Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns, and Clarity AI.
BlackRock operates in a global marketplace impacted by changing market dynamics and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.
The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in Aladdin and other technology products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives, in a manner consistent with their risk preferences, to deliver excellent client service and to innovate in technology to serve clients’ evolving needs. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.

Percentage represents CAGR over a five-year period (December 31, 2016 - December 31, 2021).
AUM represents the broad range of financial assets managed for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which BlackRock provides risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that the Company is retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.
Investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. BlackRock also earns performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, the Company also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, implementation go-lives and software solution delivery and support.
At December 31, 2021, total AUM was $10.01 trillion, representing a CAGR of 14% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including the First Reserve Transaction, which added $3.3 billion of AUM in 2017, the net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction, which added $27.5 billion of AUM in 2018, and the Aperio Transaction, which added $41.3 billion of AUM in February 2021. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.
The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:

Client Type
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, with a regionally focused business model. BlackRock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment, risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent.
Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.
ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections.
AUM by investment style and client type at December 31, 2021 is presented below.

Retail
BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the investment spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Technology solutions, digital distribution tools and a shift toward portfolio construction are increasing the number of financial advisors and end-retail investors using BlackRock products.
Retail represented 11% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2021 and 34% of long-term investment advisory and administration fees (collectively “base fees”) and securities lending revenue for 2021.
ETFs have a significant retail component but are shown separately below. With the exclusion of ETFs, retail AUM is predominantly comprised of active mutual funds. Mutual funds totaled $841.4 billion, or 81%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. 82% of retail long-term AUM is invested in active products.

•
US retail long-term net inflows of $59.7 billion were led by equity and fixed income net inflows of $24.1 billion and $20.6 billion, respectively. Equity net inflows were led by flows into US growth, technology and global equities franchises. Fixed income net inflows were diversified across exposures and products, with strong flows into unconstrained, municipal and total return bond offerings. Alternatives net inflows of $9.1 billion were driven by flows into the BlackRock Alternative Capital Strategies and Global Event Driven funds. Multi-asset net inflows of $5.9 billion included the successful close of the $2.1 billion BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Trust.
In the first quarter of 2021, BlackRock closed the acquisition of Aperio, a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts (“SMA”), to enhance its wealth platform and provide whole-portfolio solutions to ultra-high net worth advisors. The combination of Aperio with BlackRock’s existing SMA franchise expands the breadth of personalization capabilities available to wealth managers from BlackRock via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) preferences across all asset classes. In the third quarter of 2021, BlackRock made a minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors, a tech-enabled asset manager focused on providing professionally managed option overlay strategies. The Company expects this investment to add incremental product capabilities to Aperio and support expansion of its personalized SMA franchise.
•
International retail long-term net inflows of $42.4 billion were led by equity net inflows of $18.0 billion, reflecting strong flows into index equity mutual funds, and our natural resources and technology active equity franchises. In addition, equity net inflows reflected $1.4 billion raised from the launch of BlackRock’s wholly owned Fund Management Company (“FMC”) and Wealth Management Company (“WMC”) joint venture in China. Fixed income net inflows of $14.3 billion were driven by flows into index fixed income mutual funds and Asia bond strategies. Multi-asset net inflows of $6.6 billion were led by flows into ESG and world allocation strategies. Alternatives net inflows of $3.5 billion reflected demand for BlackRock’s Global Event Driven fund.
ETFs
BlackRock is the leading ETF provider in the world with $3.3 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2021, and generated record net inflows of $305.5 billion in 2021. The majority of ETF AUM and net inflows represent the Company’s index-tracking iShares-branded ETFs. The Company also offers a select number of active BlackRock-branded ETFs that seek outperformance and/or differentiated outcomes.
Equity ETF net inflows of $222.9 billion were driven by flows into core and sustainable ETFs, as well as continued client use of BlackRock’s broad-based precision exposure ETFs to express risk-on sentiment during the year. Fixed income ETF net inflows of $78.9 billion were diversified across exposures, led by flows into inflation-protected, core and municipal bond funds. Multi-asset and alternative ETFs contributed a combined $3.8 billion of net inflows, primarily into core allocation and commodities funds.
ETFs represented 35% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2021 and 41% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

Institutional active AUM ended 2021 at $1.8 trillion, reflecting $169.1 billion of net inflows, driven by broad-based strength across all product categories, the funding of several significant outsourced chief investment officer (“OCIO”) mandates and continued growth in our LifePath® target-date franchise.
Alternatives net inflows of $15.8 billion were led by inflows into private credit, infrastructure, real estate and private equity. Excluding return of capital and investment of $8.3 billion, alternatives net inflows were $24.1 billion. In addition, 2021 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives. In 2021, BlackRock raised a record $42 billion of client capital, which includes both net inflows and non-fee paying commitments raised. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $36 billion of non-fee-earning committed capital to deploy for institutional clients, which is not included in AUM.
Institutional active represented 19% of long-term AUM and 18% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.
Institutional index AUM totaled $3.2 trillion at December 31, 2021, reflecting $117.8 billion of net outflows which included a $58 billion low-fee redemption in the second quarter. Equity net outflows of $169.3 billion also reflected clients rebalancing portfolios after significant equity market gains, or tactically shifting assets to fixed income and cash. Fixed income net inflows of $52.4 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions.
Institutional index represented 35% of long-term AUM and 7% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.
The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:
•
Pensions, Foundations and Endowments. BlackRock is among the world’s largest managers of pension plan assets with $3.2 trillion, or 65%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2021. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, and our defined contribution channel represented $1.4 trillion of total pension AUM. BlackRock remains well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $96.0 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.
•
Official Institutions. BlackRock managed $316.4 billion, or 7%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2021. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.
•
Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $507.8 billion, or 10%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end 2021. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which the Company provides sub-advisory services, totaled $797.3 billion, or 16%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Long-term product offerings include alpha-seeking active and index strategies. Our alpha-seeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and ETFs.
Although many clients use both alpha-seeking active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.
Equity
Year-end 2021 equity AUM totaled $5.3 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $101.7 billion. Net inflows included $222.9 billion and $48.8 billion into ETFs and active, respectively, partially offset by non-ETF index net outflows of $170.0 billion. Record active equity net inflows were driven by flows into US growth, technology and global fundamental equities franchises, as well as flows into quantitative strategies.
BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate.
Equity represented 58% of long-term AUM and 54% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.
Fixed Income
Fixed income AUM ended 2021 at $2.8 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $230.3 billion. Net inflows included $94.0 billion, $78.9 billion and $57.4 billion in active, ETFs and non-ETF index, respectively. Record active fixed income net inflows of $94.0 billion reflected the funding of a significant core fixed income mandate in the fourth quarter, as well as strong flows into unconstrained, municipal, total return and Asia bond offerings.
Fixed income represented 30% of long-term AUM and 26% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.
Multi-Asset
BlackRock manages a variety of multi-asset balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions may include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.
Multi-asset represented 9% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

Multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $83.0 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed $53.5 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2021, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings.
The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:
•
Target date and target risk products generated net inflows of $30.5 billion. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 84% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation overlay model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products.
•
Asset allocation and balanced products generated $37.2 billion of net inflows. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families.

Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives. Fiduciary net inflows of $30.1 billion reflected the funding of several significant OCIO mandates.
Alternatives
BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into three main categories - 1) illiquid alternatives, 2) liquid alternatives, and 3) currency and commodities. Illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions, private equity, opportunistic and credit, real estate and infrastructure. Liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds).
In 2021, liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined $27.4 billion of net inflows, or $36.6 billion excluding return of capital/investment of $9.2 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital/investment were opportunistic and credit strategies, private equity solutions and infrastructure. Net inflows were driven by direct hedge funds, private equity, infrastructure and opportunistic and credit strategies. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $36 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying. Currency and commodities saw $1.6 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities ETFs.
BlackRock believes that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. BlackRock’s highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to continue to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.
Alternatives represented 3% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

Illiquid Alternatives
The Company’s illiquid alternatives strategies include the following:
•
Alternative Solutions represents highly customized portfolios of alternative investments. In 2021, alternative solutions portfolios had $6.0 billion in AUM, and $1.4 billion of net inflows.
•
Private Equity and Opportunistic included AUM of $19.4 billion in private equity solutions, $19.3 billion in opportunistic and credit offerings, and $3.5 billion in Long Term Private Capital (“LTPC”). Net inflows of $9.1 billion into private equity and opportunistic strategies included $6.3 billion of net inflows into opportunistic and credit offerings and $2.8 billion of net inflows into private equity solutions.
•
Real Assets, which includes infrastructure and real estate, totaled $54.4 billion in AUM, reflecting net inflows of $5.7 billion, led by infrastructure capital raise and deployments.
Liquid Alternatives
The Company’s liquid alternatives products’ net inflows of $11.3 billion reflected net inflows of $10.0 billion and $1.3 billion from direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions, respectively. Direct hedge fund strategies includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings.
In addition, the Company manages $103.9 billion in liquid credit strategies which is included in active fixed income.
Currency and Commodities
The Company’s currency and commodities products include a range of active and index products.
Currency and commodities products had $1.6 billion of net inflows, primarily driven by ETFs. ETF commodities products represented $65.6 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.
Cash Management
Cash management AUM totaled $755.1 billion at December 31, 2021, reflecting a record $94.0 billion of net inflows. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds, short-term investment funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs, New Zealand Dollars or British pounds. Strong growth in cash management reflects BlackRock’s success in leveraging scale for clients and delivering innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions.
BlackRock is currently voluntarily waiving a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a minimum level of daily net investment income. During 2021, these waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $500 million, which was partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock’s distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. BlackRock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of yield support waivers in future periods. For more information see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, providing an end-to-end, SaaS solution for investment and risk management for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional and retail investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via Aladdin Risk, as well as investment accounting capabilities. Aladdin Provider is a tool used by asset servicers, connecting them to the platform used by asset managers and owners to add operational efficiency. In 2020, BlackRock launched Aladdin Climate, a software application offering investors measures of both the physical risk of climate change and the transition risk to a low-carbon economy on portfolios with climate-adjusted security valuations and risk metrics. In 2019, BlackRock acquired eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider to enable clients to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. Through our Cachematrix platform, BlackRock is also a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform.
BlackRock offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering personalized digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities.
Technology services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 12% year-over-year, and annual contract value1 (“ACV”) increased 13% year-over-year. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue. At the end of any period, BlackRock generally has recurring revenue contracts in place for a large portion of total annual revenue. BlackRock measures the fees related to these agreements and refers to this as ACV.
At year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.
Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions across public and private markets. BlackRock is focused on enhancing Aladdin, with continued investment into areas such as whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and a leading sustainable investing solution. Building on eFront’s industry-leading tools for private asset classes, Aladdin was an early mover to provide data transparency and analytics across public and private assets with over two dozen clients using the capabilities today. To deliver best-in-class sustainability capabilities in Aladdin, including within Aladdin Climate, BlackRock acquired the transition risk models of Baringa through a long term partnership with ongoing innovation and solution development, and the physical risk models of Rhodium, in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. Additionally, BlackRock made a minority investment in Clarity AI in January 2021 and has integrated these capabilities within Aladdin.
BlackRock is also investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth by migrating Aladdin from BlackRock-hosted data centers to the cloud. This will bring enhanced capabilities to BlackRock and its Aladdin clients, accelerating innovation and supporting greater computing scale and flexibility for clients. Through this migration as well as BlackRock’s partnership with Snowflake, an industry leader in cloud enabled data technology, BlackRock is building Aladdin Data Cloud, a next generation solution that will bring Aladdin and non-Aladdin data together, so clients can nimbly access and use data across their organization, unlocking their full potential for collaboration, creativity, and innovation.
In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in the digital distribution companies Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, and Acorns. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense).
Securities Lending
Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash received as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.
Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $389 billion, up from $352 billion at year-end 2020. Strong demand for securities resulted in higher balances compared to 2020. On average, relative to 2020, intrinsic lending spreads were higher, while cash reinvestment spreads were lower as cash yields continue to be compressed. Increased demand for specific securities and corporate action lending activity offset the impact of narrower cash reinvestment spreads.
ACV represents forward-looking, annualized estimated value of the recurring subscription fees under client contracts, assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed, unless we received a notice of termination, even though such notice may not be effective until a later date. ACV also includes the annualized estimated value of new sales, for existing and new clients, when we execute client contracts, even though the recurring fees may not be effective until a later date and excludes nonrecurring fees such as implementation and consulting fees.
BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.
Risk & Quantitative Analysis
Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.
COMPETITION
BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.
HUMAN CAPITAL
With approximately 18,400 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. As an asset manager, BlackRock’s long-term success depends on its people and how it manages its workforce.
Culture and Principles
BlackRock believes that developing a strong corporate culture is an important component of its human capital management practices and critical to the firm’s long-term success. BlackRock’s culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify its workforce and guide how it interacts with its employees, its clients, the communities in which it operates and all of its other stakeholders: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock; (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)
BlackRock believes a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive work environment are key factors in achieving better outcomes across all levels of its business. BlackRock has made a long-term commitment to cultivating diversity in its workforce and leadership team through its hiring, retention, promotion and development practices. As part of this long-term commitment, BlackRock has instituted a multi-year DEI strategy that it believes is actionable, measurable and designed to apply across the many countries in which the firm operates. The Company has aligned its DEI strategy with the firm’s business priorities and long-term objectives. BlackRock’s DEI strategy centers on talent and culture, responding to the needs of our clients, and policy and social impact in the communities in which we operate.
To advance its DEI strategy, BlackRock will strive to:
•
Expand partnerships with external organizations and develop strategies to increase the diversity of applicant pools;
•
Strengthen talent acquisition and management processes in an effort to eliminate bias; and
•
Implement leadership development, sponsorship and coaching initiatives to engage and develop underrepresented talent.
Another focus of BlackRock’s DEI strategy is to cultivate an inclusive, equitable work environment in which employees feel connected to BlackRock’s culture and supported in pursuit of their professional goals. To this end, BlackRock has committed to raising awareness of racial equity issues and setting high behavioral expectations for employees, as well as to holding firm leaders and managers accountable for continued progress against the firm’s goals.
BlackRock views transparency and accountability as a critical part of its DEI strategy, including as a means to inform, measure and improve its human capital management practices. To that end, since 2020, the firm has published annual SASB-aligned disclosure, and in 2020, also published for the first time its annual EEO-1 report, both of which include information regarding workforce diversity. During 2020, it also set goals for increasing the overall workplace representation of Black and Latinx employees and growing the number of female and US Black and Latinx leaders at the Director level and above. As of January 1, 2022, of the Company’s employees who self-identified their gender status, 43.5% of global employees were women. As of January 1, 2022, of the Company’s US employees who self-identified their race/ethnicity status, 6.9% identified as Black or African American, 6.8% identified as Hispanic/Latinx, 26.0% identified as Asian and 2.5% identified as Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or as “two or more races”.
Board Oversight of Human Capital Management
BlackRock’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management at BlackRock and devotes one Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock’s culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, DEI strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, year-end business assessments, which include a review of the progress that is being made against the firm’s DEI goals, influence individual compensation outcomes that are reviewed and approved by the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee.
Succession planning for BlackRock’s Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives is a key part of the Board’s annual review of human capital management issues. As part of this review, the Board focuses on whether BlackRock has the right people in place to execute the Company’s long-term strategic plans, and on BlackRock’s ability to identify, attract, develop, promote and retain future senior executives. An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within and increasing diversity in leadership roles.
Employee Engagement
BlackRock values continuous dialogue with its employees about their experiences at the firm in order to understand employee expectations and assess the efficacy of its human capital management practices. The Company uses several employee engagement mechanisms, including: (i) employee opinion surveys; (ii) interactive townhalls and communications; and (iii) the sponsorship of employee, professional and social impact networks. These employee engagement mechanisms provide BlackRock with actionable feedback for each team and for BlackRock as a whole. BlackRock’s employee, professional and social impact networks also provide additional forums and opportunities for employees with diverse backgrounds to connect with one another and shape the firm’s culture. These networks played, and continue to play, an active role in BlackRock’s response to COVID-19, including by instituting programs to combat isolation and more deeply understand the employee experience during the pandemic. The networks also have served a critical role in the firm’s dialogue around issues of racial injustice and inequity. The networks, which continue to grow in number, are sponsored by senior leaders and designed by employees, for employees.
Compensation, Wellness and Benefits
BlackRock is committed to responsible business practices and believes that investing in the physical, emotional, mental and financial well-being of its employees is a critical component of the firm’s human capital management strategy. To that end, the Company designs its compensation and benefits practices to: (i) attract, retain and motivate talented employees; (ii) align employee incentives and risk-taking with that of the firm and the interests of its clients; and (iii) support employees across many aspects of their lives. The Company has a strong pay-for-performance culture and an annual compensation process that takes into consideration firmwide results, individual business results and employee performance, as well as market benchmarks. BlackRock also offers a wide range of benefits that it regularly reviews in accordance with leading practices and the local requirements of its offices, including, where applicable, retirement savings plans, a Flexible Time Off (“FTO”) policy and flexible working arrangements, and parental leave and family support benefits, including fertility benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, and backup elder and childcare benefits. The Company provides comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, counseling services, an employee assistance program and access to telemedicine services, where available.
BlackRock prioritizes protecting the rights of its workforce and the equitable treatment of its employees. The Company has implemented policies related to harassment prevention and compliance with equal employment opportunity and overtime regulations. BlackRock is also committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for its workforce. To do this, it designs global programs, including environmental and occupational health and safety programs, to meet or exceed local requirements. Moreover, BlackRock encourages all of its employees to raise issues of concern and assures employees that they may do so without fear of retaliation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy and BlackRock has continued to implement initiatives to support employees. During the pandemic, the Company has prioritized communication about the telemedicine and digital health resources it makes available, including mental, emotional and physical health offerings. For example, the Company created a Mental Health Ambassador program that trained global volunteers across office locations to act as allies for firmwide mental health awareness and direct colleagues to mental health training resources, and the Company rolled out several new benefits to support mental health. BlackRock also launched its Future of Work pilot program to provide employees with flexibility for remote and hybrid work environments in offices across the US and Europe in 2021, and invested in COVID-19 testing, COVID-19 vaccine education and access and other office safety measures. In addition, the Company extended cross-border healthcare coverage and support to employees and their dependents temporarily working, or on FTO, outside of their home country as a result of the pandemic.
Training, Innovation and Development
BlackRock is committed to innovation, learning and reinvention in all areas of its business and believes that developing the capabilities of its employees is integral to delivering long-term value. To that end, the Company’s human capital management practices are designed to provide opportunities for employees to learn, innovate and enhance their skillsets at every stage of their career. Examples include hosting small group conversations led by external facilitators to help employees build skills necessary to cultivate inclusive environments, and the firm’s online suite of interactive resources and courses (BlackRock Academies), which enable employees to build skills in specific facets of BlackRock’s business and purpose. The Company believes these opportunities play an important role in engaging BlackRock’s employees.
In addition, BlackRock believes that a critical driver of its future growth is its ability to grow strong leaders. The Company is investing in leadership development programs designed to foster career growth. For example, select employees are invited to participate in programs that include executive coaching, in-person and virtual learning and senior management sponsorship.
REGULATION
Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.
BlackRock’s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, securities, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.
GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM
Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) and Bank for International Settlements, may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Most recently, such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities of non-bank financial institutions, money market funds, open-ended funds (“OEFs”), central counterparty margin practices and enhanced ESG disclosures.
Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers
Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic and prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). The European Union (“EU”) has proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs, to enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and to expand the powers of national regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require BlackRock to make changes to structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.
International Money Market Fund Reforms
Following the market events of March 2020, US, EU and United Kingdom (“UK”) authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of money market funds in market downturns. The review of the EU Money Market Fund Regulation in 2022 could result in significant changes to the rules around liquidity and how some money market funds price shares. The UK may materially depart from the EU approach as they develop their own legal and regulatory framework for money market funds domiciled or marketed in the UK. In the US, the SEC has proposed changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act governing money market funds, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of those funds, and changes in pricing under certain circumstances. Such regulatory reforms, if adopted, could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock’s money market fund products.
ESG and Sustainability Regulations
ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. Globally, the newly created International Sustainability Standards Board and the development of its disclosure standards may inform national regulators’ approaches on these topics. In the US, the SEC has publicly announced that it plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding climate change, human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased its scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers’ and funds’ ESG strategies. In addition, the US Department of Labor (the “DoL”) has proposed regulations that could affect how ESG factors are considered for purposes of investing assets of plans that are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and the exercise of voting rights with respect to plan investments.
The EU has introduced regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investment products, and issuers; require integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; and make the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences. The first set of rules initially took effect in March 2021, with secondary rules to come into force over the course of 2022 and 2023. In addition, requirements for asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities took effect at the start of 2022, with a further phase expected in 2023, and new proposed regulation to enhance sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers is expected to take effect in 2024. Moreover, several European jurisdictions impose additional restrictions around the offer of ESG funds through labelling, disclosure or marketing requirements at both the fund and asset management level.
In Asia, regulators in Singapore and Hong Kong have introduced requirements for asset managers to integrate climate risk considerations in investment and risk management processes, together with enhanced disclosure and reporting, beginning in 2022. Hong Kong has also issued enhanced rules for ESG funds sold to retail investors and guidelines for pension trustees on ESG risk management and disclosure.
Taxation
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission (“EC”) has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
LIBOR Transition
The global transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) continues to progress. Tenors of non-USD LIBOR ceased to be published at the end of 2021 while publication of most USD LIBOR settings is expected to continue through June 2023. US federal legislation regarding the transition of certain contracts, for which removing a LIBOR setting is not easily achievable, has yet to be finalized. If such legislation is not enacted, parties to such unremediated contracts, and the markets more generally, face the potential for uncertainty, disputes, litigation and market disruption.
Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds
As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of ETFs in the markets, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other sponsors of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company’s business.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements.
In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to central clearing and trading venue execution requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (""Dodd-Frank""), with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. On March 1, 2017, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, became subject to requirements in the US, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks.
US REGULATORY REFORM
Federal Trade Commission Proposal
In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing certain changes to premerger notification rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which exemption would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely creating significant tracking error and cash drag for index funds and opportunity costs for actively managed funds, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where filing a pre-merger notification may not be practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock’s aggregate position in certain issuers if BlackRock is unable to satisfy the revised regulatory requirements.
SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers
The SEC and its staff have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. The SEC has adopted rules that include among other things: (i) the regulation of the use of derivatives, (ii) a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures and (iii) an updated regulatory framework for fund valuation practices.
Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) Review
The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States under Dodd-Frank. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management, which was re-affirmed in December 2019 with its change in methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. However, the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“HFCAA”) was enacted in December 2020 and requires the SEC to identify issuers that use a registered public accounting firm to issue an audit report where the firm is located in a foreign jurisdiction that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction. The PCAOB and SEC have recently finalized their respective rules to implement the HFCAA, which could subject certain foreign issuers’ securities to trading prohibitions in US markets and subsequent delisting from US exchanges as early as 2024. As a result, certain BlackRock products may be impacted and BlackRock may be subject to additional regulatory, compliance and disclosure requirements, which may be costly.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
The SEC, Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, any such limitations or restrictions could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.
In October 2020, the SEC adopted new regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (“RICs”), including mutual funds (other than money market funds), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. RICs will be required to implement and comply with the new rule by the third quarter of 2022. Once implemented, the rule will, among other things, impose limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a RIC can enter into, eliminate the current asset segregation compliance framework and introduce new compliance requirements for funds, including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs. The rule may impact certain RICs’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy.
On December 15, 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (“SBS”) transactions, to prevent undue influence over Chief Compliance Officers of SBS dealers and major market participants and to require reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts, and increase BlackRock’s regulatory compliance and disclosure requirements.
SEC Proposed Rules on Private Fund Advisers
The SEC has recently proposed new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These include proposed amendments to Form PF for SEC-registered investment advisers that add new required disclosures to the form, require advisers to file reports within one business day for certain significant events, lower the threshold for large private equity adviser reporting and impose increased reporting obligations on large liquidity fund advisers. The SEC has also proposed additional rules that would, among other things, require registered private fund advisers to (i) provide quarterly reports to investors of fund performance, fees and expenses, (ii) obtain an annual audit for each fund and (iii) distribute to investors a fairness opinion and summary of certain material business relationships with the opinion provider in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction. In addition, the proposed rules would prohibit private fund advisers from engaging in certain activities and practices deemed to be contrary to the public interest and investor protection, providing certain types of preferential terms for selected investors and providing any other preferential treatment unless disclosed to current and prospective investors. These rules and amendments, if adopted as proposed, could significantly increase BlackRock’s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock’s alternatives products.
SEC Rule 15c2-11
SEC Rule 15c2-11 governs the submission of quotes into quotation systems by broker-dealers and has historically been applied to the over-the-counter (“OTC”) equity markets. However, the SEC recently stated that it intends to apply the rule to fixed income markets. The SEC staff also issued no-action relief in December 2021 setting out a phased implementation period for applying the rule to segments of the fixed income markets. While material impacts are not expected in Phase 1 of the implementation, Phase 2 may disrupt primary and secondary market liquidity, which could adversely impact BlackRock’s business activities.
Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS
In January 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of “exchange” and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules could impact certain functionality and tools offered by Aladdin and require ATS registration, which may increase compliance costs for BlackRock.
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers
In 2015, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Proposed Rule”) that would extend to a number of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Advisers Act, the requirement to establish written risk-based anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”). The Proposed Rule would include investment advisers within the Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of “financial institutions”, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements. If adopted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs.
INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORM
EU Market Access and Outsourcing
In November 2021, the EU formally published legislative proposals amending both the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) and Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”) fund frameworks. The proposed changes remain broadly consistent with the current regulatory framework but with increased notification requirements to national regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), enhanced liquidity management requirements and new requirements for loan originating funds. There is a proposal that would require notification for instances of significant delegation of portfolio management or risk management functions to entities located outside the EU. ESMA would then be required to present market analysis and supervisory peer review every two years to the European Parliament. These proposals and any further regulatory actions could impact delegated activities, increase compliance costs and impact products and services offered to EU clients.
Revised Capital Requirements for Investment Firms
In June 2021, the Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for investment firms in scope of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive for investment firms proposed by the European Commission (the “EC”) came into effect, resulting in changes to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in the EU, changes to the method of calculating such capital and liquidity, and revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK has also adopted comparable rules, which have applied to UK-based investment firms from January 2022. Changes
to the supervisory approach to assessing the risk of harm posed by BlackRock’s operations or asset management activities more broadly could increase the amount of regulatory capital and liquidity required to be held in the future, and the new rules impose other prudential requirements.
Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms
The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), proposed by the EC in September 2020 and currently going through the EU's ordinary legislative procedure, focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services. If enacted as proposed, DORA may, among other things: (i) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (ii) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. Separately, in November 2020, the FSB released a Consultation on Regulatory and Supervisory Issues Relating to Outsourcing and Third-Party Relationships, which explores direct supervision of technology service providers to financial services firms, in addition to detailing concerns around the potential for systemic risk in the provision of such services.
Central Securities Depository Regulation
Aspects of the settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation came into effect on February 1, 2022. These include rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions. However, the mandatory buy-in regime was delayed. Implementation of the regime required new operational mechanisms to facilitate compliance, which may increase resources and cost.
UK Divergence Reforms
Several UK regimes are currently subject to regulatory changes as the UK diverges from on-shored EU rules following the UK’s exit from the EU, including the Wholesale Markets Regime on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments frameworks, which is open to public consultation through 2022, and the regime for non-UK-based funds that are recognized for sale into the UK, which is currently under government review. The introduction and implementation of any proposed changes to these regimes may lead to additional expenses and operational complexity and may impact products available to UK investors.
UK Conduct Regime
The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the application of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”) and a new Consumer Duty to all asset management firms, including BlackRock’s UK subsidiaries. The SMCR imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all Company staff in the UK and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities. The new Consumer Duty enhances duties on firms to take end-consumer duty interests into account when designing and managing retail products or services. Any failure to meet the FCA’s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock and its senior managers to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk, which could in turn adversely affect the Company’s business in the UK.
Reform of Investment Markets
BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company’s provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The Regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms, which came into force in January 2018, were substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. Forthcoming proposals to review the operation of MiFID II and to develop a new EU Retail Investment Strategy may affect the European market structure and impact BlackRock’s ability to operate in European markets. The broad nature of the MiFID II means future reforms could also affect product development, client servicing and distribution models. Similar reforms have been implemented in Switzerland and Australia.
Regulatory Environment in China
The Company’s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company’s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on the transfer of the Company’s Chinese onshore data to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock’s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock’s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance.
EXISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DoL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the FTC, the Department of Justice, the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies.
Certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through attorneys general, insurance commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities.
The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities
laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, Dodd-Frank requires one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”). BTC's registration as a municipal advisor subjects BTC to additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.
BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, real estate funds, collective trust funds, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rulemaking or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA.
BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of Dodd-Frank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. In addition, two of BlackRock’s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also a member of the MSRB and is subject to MSRB rules.
BlackRock’s business activity in California that involves the processing of personal information is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA imposes obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA may result in fines, heightened regulatory scrutiny, litigation and/or reputational harm.
US Banking Regulation
One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC’s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders.
US Regulation of Securities Financing Transactions
In its 2014 Annual Report, FSOC identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions.
EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.
Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.
Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.
European Regulation
The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branches of one of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital and liquidity resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business requirements, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.
In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established, including the branches of the Netherlands entity which operate across the EU.
BlackRock’s EU subsidiaries and branches must comply with the EU regulatory regime set out in MiFID II. BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries must comply with the UK version of MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities in the UK. MiFID II, and the UK equivalent of MiFID II, sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. The legislation also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock UK subsidiaries must also comply with the UK regulation which implements the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for certain investment firms. These include requirements to ensure capital adequacy, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, as implemented in the relevant EU Member States and in the UK, which impose obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of retail and alternative investment funds respectively that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will affect certain of BlackRock’s European operations. Compliance with the UCITS Directives and the AIFMD may subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements.
BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to Regulation 2012648/EU (""EMIR"") (or the UK version of EMIR transposed into UK law in accordance with The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in the case of BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of certain OTC derivatives; (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties); and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an ESMA registered or recognized derivatives trade repository (or a UK authorized trade repository in the case of the UK version of EMIR).
The EU has seen an increase in Common Supervisory Actions by ESMA to coordinate supervisory action by national EU regulators, most notably in areas such as product governance, liquidity management and fund costs and charges. BlackRock’s EU operations may be affected to the extent this initiative results in formal legislation or action.
EU Member States, the UK and many other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of personal data security breaches if certain thresholds are met. For example, in May 2018, the EU Data Protection Directive was replaced by a more extensive General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). In addition, the UK transposed the GDPR into national law (“UK GDPR”). In July 2020, the EU-US Privacy Shield was invalidated as a valid personal data transfer mechanism and in June 2021, the EC published a new set of standard contractual clauses, which only apply to the transfer of personal data outside of the EU to a country not approved by the EU as providing an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data. The EU's adequacy decision with respect to the UK, which allows the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, will be regularly reviewed and may be revoked if the UK diverges from its current adequate data protection laws. The UK has developed its own international data transfer agreement set to be implemented in March 2022. GDPR and UK GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock’s collection, processing, retention and transfer of personal data and reporting of personal data security breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.

As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, reputational, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.
MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS
Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, could cause:
•
the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;
•
client redemptions from BlackRock’s products;
•
client rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;
•
an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•
a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.
These risks may also be heightened by market volatility, illiquid market conditions or other market disruptions. The occurrence of any of the above events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock’s AUM and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s net income and operating cash flows.
In recent years, there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates, interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates. BlackRock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Similarly, due to the global nature of BlackRock’s operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the US dollar. Any failure by BlackRock to manage movements in foreign exchange rates relative to the US dollar or its exposure to interest rates may cause BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s base fees, net income and operating cash flows.
In addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees.
BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund’s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on similar terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance.
Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The investment management industry is highly competitive, and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, liquidity, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, over the past several years, there has been significant consolidation in the asset management and financial services industries as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multi-asset investment capabilities and technological expertise, including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs. This consolidation, together with the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with the products, services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock’s competitive success. Aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform flexibility or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, to the extent that Aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than BlackRock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, BlackRock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in Aladdin.
BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk.
BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. Conversely, the development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of products with concentrations in industries or sectors specific to individual client criteria, or with a focus on ESG matters, requires continued innovative effort on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services, constraints on our ability to manage growth within client mandates, compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements and intellectual property-related lawsuits or claims. A growing number of new products and services also depend on data provided by third parties as analytical inputs and are subject to additional risks, including with respect to data quality, cost, availability and provider relationships. Data sets for certain developing analytics, such as those in the sustainability space, are evolving and difficulties approximating gaps in data or sourcing data from reliable sources could adversely impact the accuracy and effectiveness of such tools. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timescale they require. Any failure to successfully develop new products and services, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm BlackRock’s reputation and expose the Company to additional costs, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns as well as certain of BlackRock’s minority investments could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.
At December 31, 2021, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $3.7 billion in its investments (see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as certain minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline.
BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.
BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2021 and subject to this type of indemnification was $286 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $304 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2021. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Any decision by BlackRock to support products may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. BlackRock’s ability to support certain products may be restricted by regulation or by the Company’s failure to have or make available sufficient capital or liquidity. Moreover, inherent constraints arising from the business models of certain asset managers, including BlackRock, may during periods of market volatility result in BlackRock having fewer options for accessing liquidity than asset managers with alternate business models, which may adversely impact its ability to support certain products. Any decision by BlackRock to support particular products, or the inability to provide such support, may result in losses, which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock’s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, terrorist activity or acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. For instance, military conflict and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine could result in geopolitical instability and adversely affect the global economy or specific markets. Strategic competition between the US and China and resulting tensions have also contributed to uncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory landscapes. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock’s control, including natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company’s products, operations, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackRock currently operates or is seeking to expand its presence.
Climate change-related risks could adversely affect BlackRock’s business, products, operations and clients, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s business and those of its clients could be impacted by climate change-related risks. Climate change may present risk to BlackRock through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Climate-related physical risks arise from the direct impacts of a changing climate in the short- and long-term. Such risks may include the risks of extreme weather events and changes in temperature, which may damage infrastructure and facilities, including BlackRock’s physical assets, as well as disrupt connectivity or supply chains. Climate-related transition risks arise from exposure to the transition to a lower-carbon economy through policy, regulatory, technology and market changes. For instance, new regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as the perspectives of stakeholders regarding climate change, may affect BlackRock’s business activities and reputation and increase disclosure requirements, which could increase the Company’s costs.
Climate-related physical and transition risks could impact BlackRock both directly and indirectly through adverse impacts to its clients, including as a result of declines in asset values, changes in client preferences, increased regulatory and compliance costs and significant business disruptions. Any of these risks may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE
Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:
•
client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors;
•
client shifts to products that charge lower fees;
•
the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;
•
reduced, minimal or no performance fees;
•
an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•
a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital.
Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.
A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $1.1 billion, or 6%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company’s performance fee generating assets. In particular, as BlackRock manages more illiquid products, performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products.
Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.
BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, ESG considerations, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors or limitations in the underlying models, model inputs or assumptions, as well as any failure of BlackRock’s governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models, model inputs or assumptions, could have unanticipated and adverse effects on BlackRock’s business and reputation.
RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect BlackRock’s business, operations and financial condition which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and may adversely affect BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in governmental authorities taking numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020, the pandemic began to impact BlackRock’s business. While global markets have significantly recovered since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing and could be prolonged or worsen and have an ongoing adverse impact on BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:
•
reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of BlackRock’s investment portfolio, including its co-investments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;
•
lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and BlackRock’s ability to generate performance fees;
•
reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;
•
a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as some clients continue to work remotely;
•
negative impact of the pandemic on BlackRock’s clients, and key vendors (such as pricing providers), market participants and other third parties with whom it does business;
•
the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment and the introduction of hybrid working models, including strain on Aladdin and/or BlackRock’s other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity and fraud risks;
•
continued periods away from physical office locations and daily in-person interactions with colleagues that could cause members of BlackRock’s workforce to become disconnected with corporate culture and policies, which may increase operational issues due to distractions, fatigue or a lack of oversight; and
•
the disruption to BlackRock’s workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations of remote and hybrid work environments (including any complications associated with hiring and onboarding new employees remotely), and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.
The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and the related impact on the global economy, affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the emergence and spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees, and may exacerbate the other risks described herein.
TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS
A failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock’s operations, systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the Company’s reputation and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London, Budapest, Atlanta and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), health crisis or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt BlackRock’s operations in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth. In addition, these risks and risks related to supply chain and labor constraints could adversely impact BlackRock’s move to its new headquarters in New York, which is currently expected to begin in late 2022.
Despite BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations or contractual obligations leading to reputational harm, legal liability, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.
A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them, including data provided by third parties that is significant to portions of its business and products. An externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack including a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, or denial-of-service or ransomware attack, or an internally caused incident or disruption, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, developments in BlackRock’s use of process automation, as well as the increased use of remote access by employees and mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock’s control. BlackRock’s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information or third-party data. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.
The financial services industry has been the subject of cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors and terrorist organizations. BlackRock has been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and cause financial losses. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective. In addition, a successful cyber-attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and it may take a considerable amount of time for an investigation to be completed and the severity and potential impact to be known. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock’s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock’s systems.
In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock or any such third party may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock or such third parties may not have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.
Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, BlackRock’s cybersecurity insurance may not cover all losses and damages from such events and BlackRock’s ability to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future may be limited.
Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
BlackRock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. In so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers. For example, Aladdin’s data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to Aladdin’s growth. In addition, the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin’s analytical calculations. Although BlackRock has implemented internal controls and procedures and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the Aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. Any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with Aladdin’s size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise Aladdin’s resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients.
Continuing enhancements to Aladdin’s capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.
The operation of BlackRock’s Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, configuration change management, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. These updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose BlackRock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, increased costs, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
In addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions.
Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.
BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. In addition, while BlackRock, Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements, certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards, which require them to maintain certain levels of capital and liquidity. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.
Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses.
BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks.
Inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.
BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, deliver whole-portfolio solutions, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures, entering into strategic joint ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses, analytics, models and other intellectual property. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases, the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions, and such transactions may be the subject of unanticipated liabilities arising from commercial disputes, information security vulnerabilities or breaches and intellectual property or other legal claims. The success of BlackRock’s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock’s inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products or business lines or are delivered via technology and systems that differ from that employed by BlackRock. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock’s control. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, governance or oversight rights, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry.
Client investments in real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.
BlackRock makes investments on behalf of its clients in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, that may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. These may include:
•
construction risks, including as a result of force majeure, labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;
•
accidents, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), health crises or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control;
•
risks associated with global climate change, including the greater frequency or intensity of adverse weather and natural disasters;
•
personal injury or property damage;
•
failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;
•
exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;
•
environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;
•
changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;
•
risks related to the availability, cost, coverage and other limitations on insurance;
•
the financial resources of tenants; and
•
contingent liabilities on disposition of assets.
The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock’s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management’s attention away from BlackRock’s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks.
As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Operating outside the US may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher compliance costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. Similarly, certain jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates may not have comparable levels of protection for corporate assets, such as intellectual property, and client information and records, as the US. As a result, there may also be heightened information security or privacy risks in those jurisdictions. Any theft of data, technology or intellectual property may negatively impact BlackRock’s business operations and reputation. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL
The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Many of BlackRock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock’s operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, or errors in judgment. Such risks may be exacerbated in times of increased market volatility. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks. Notwithstanding these measures, BlackRock cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks and BlackRock employees have in the past engaged in improper conduct. In addition, BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may in the future deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. This risk may be heightened as BlackRock expands into new markets, increases the breadth of its business offerings and provides remote and alternative work models, all of which introduce additional complexity to its risk management program. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, cause adverse publicity, and result in litigation, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is highly competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company’s reputation and workplace culture, the immigration and public health policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, its approach to remote and alternative work models, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.
In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, if BlackRock’s share price were to decrease, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.
RISKS RELATED TO KEY THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS
The impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that BlackRock manages, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose BlackRock’s clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. Counterparties may also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk management systems or expose BlackRock and/or its clients to losses on account of employee malfeasance, negligence or human error. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackRock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple BlackRock clients. Any such operational issue, impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts that BlackRock manages for its clients, which may lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure of key third-party providers to BlackRock to fulfill their obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock depends on a number of key third-party providers for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market and ESG data, market indices, insurance, technology and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients’ investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock’s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. While BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. In addition, BlackRock’s operations and processes rely on commercially available data provided by third parties as well as providers of services, including technology services, and operating errors, process failures or failures to comply with data usage requirements with respect to these service providers may adversely impact BlackRock. Data providers commonly disclaim the accuracy and completeness of data and BlackRock does not have the ability to validate or verify the accuracy and completeness of commercially sourced datasets. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock’s arrangement with a vendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.
BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one third-party provider to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex, and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key third-party provider to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management or other agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational, legal and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company’s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock.
Key technology partnerships may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory oversight, as well as migration, execution, technology and operational risks.
In April 2020, BlackRock announced a strategic partnership to host Aladdin infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure cloud and commenced a multi-year plan to migrate the Aladdin environments for BlackRock and its external Aladdin clients to the cloud. The benefits of a cloud-based platform are significant and BlackRock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its migration strategy; however the partnership also introduces new risks, including: (i) risks associated with relying on a third-party for aspects of the reliability and stability of Aladdin’s infrastructure; (ii) software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology; (iii) operational and execution risks, including those related to migration; and (iv) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations, which risks may be further exacerbated as the Aladdin platform continues to grow. Any failure by BlackRock to manage these risks, and/or risks associated with future potential technology partnerships, may result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.
BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value (“NAV”). The NAV of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF’s holdings. The trading price of the ETF’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. The creation/redemption feature and arbitrage mechanism of an ETF are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the NAV. Notwithstanding these features, exchange prices have in the past deviated measurably from the NAV of certain ETFs and may under certain circumstances do so in the future. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, and the inability or unwillingness of market makers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively. These risks may be heightened as a result of significant market volatility, the accelerating growth of the ETF industry combined with increased market activity, as well as the complexity associated with the growing demand for product customization. Although certain structural improvements have contributed to the increasing resilience, stability and transparency of ETF markets, including during periods of volatility, and despite BlackRock’s continuing work with regulators and other third parties to implement additional ETF reforms, there can be no assurance that any such reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate meaningfully from an ETF’s NAV, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS
BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world, which increases its cost of doing business.
BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex.
In addition, many of BlackRock’s legal entities are subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the UK Bribery Act, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations and the EU and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which BlackRock operates, such as Her Majesty’s Treasury’s (“HMT”) Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation.
BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the GDPR and UK GDPR, which expand data protection rules for individuals within the EU and UK, respectively, and for personal data exported outside the EU and UK.
BlackRock is additionally subject to scrutiny from various government agencies that focus on antitrust and competition laws and regulations within the US and internationally, including in connection with merger control proceedings and proposed investments. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company’s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted.
BlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BTC’s bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see Item 1, Business - Regulation.
New regulations informed by global standard setters and/or developed by various national authorities may expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) and Bank for International Settlements, may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Most recently, such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities of non-bank financial institutions, money market funds, open-ended funds (“OEFs”), central counterparty margin practices and enhanced ESG disclosures. BlackRock is, and may become, subject to increasing regulation in these areas, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, including:
•
Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers: Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic and prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). The EU has proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs, to enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and to expand the powers of national regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require BlackRock to make changes to structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.
•
International Money Market Fund Reforms: Following the market events of March 2020, US, EU and UK authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of money market funds in market downturns. The review of the EU Money Market Fund Regulation in 2022 could result in significant changes to the rules around liquidity and how some money market funds price shares. The UK may materially depart from the EU approach as they develop their own legal and regulatory framework for money market funds domiciled or marketed in the UK. In the US, the SEC has proposed changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act governing money market funds, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of those funds, and changes in pricing under certain circumstances. Such regulatory reforms, if adopted, could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock’s money market fund products.
•
ESG and Sustainability Regulations: ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. Globally, the newly created International Sustainability Standards Board and the development of its disclosure standards may inform national regulators’ approaches on these topics. In the US, the SEC has publicly announced that it plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding climate change, human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased its scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers’ and funds’ ESG strategies. In addition, the US Department of Labor has proposed regulations that could affect how ESG factors are considered for purposes of investing assets of plans that are subject to ERISA, and the exercise of voting rights with respect to plan investments.
The EU has introduced regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investment products, and issuers; require integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; and make the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences. The first set of rules initially took effect in March 2021, with secondary rules to come into force over the course of 2022 and 2023. In addition, requirements for asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities took effect at the start of 2022, with a further phase expected in 2023, and new proposed regulation to enhance sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers is expected to take effect in 2024. Moreover, several European jurisdictions impose additional restrictions around the offer of ESG funds through labelling, disclosure or marketing requirements at both the fund and asset management level.
In Asia, regulators in Singapore and Hong Kong have introduced requirements for asset managers to integrate climate risk considerations in investment and risk management processes, together with enhanced disclosure and reporting, beginning in 2022. Hong Kong has also issued enhanced rules for ESG funds sold to retail investors and guidelines for pension trustees on ESG risk management and disclosure.
•
LIBOR Transition: The global transition away from LIBOR continues to progress. Tenors of non-USD LIBOR ceased to be published at the end of 2021 while publication of most USD LIBOR settings is expected to continue through June 2023. US federal legislation regarding the transition of certain contracts, for which removing a LIBOR setting is not easily achievable, has yet to be finalized. If such legislation is not enacted, parties to such unremediated contracts, and the markets more generally, face the potential for uncertainty, disputes, litigation and market disruption.
Global regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
Regulatory reforms in the United States expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
In recent years, a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the United States, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the United States, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:
•
Federal Trade Commission Proposal: In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing certain changes to premerger notification rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which exemption would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely creating significant tracking error and cash drag for index funds and opportunity costs for actively managed funds, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where filing a pre-merger notification may not be practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock’s aggregate position in certain issuers if BlackRock is unable to satisfy the revised regulatory requirements.
•
SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC and its staff have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. The SEC has adopted rules that include among other things: (i) the regulation of the use of derivatives, (ii) a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures and (iii) an updated regulatory framework for fund valuation practices.
•
Designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”): The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management, which was re-affirmed in December 2019 with its change in methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. However, the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.
•
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act: The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“HFCAA”) was enacted in December 2020 and requires the SEC to identify issuers that use a registered public accounting firm to issue an audit report where the firm is located in a foreign jurisdiction that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction. The PCAOB and SEC have recently finalized their respective rules to implement the HFCAA, which could subject certain foreign issuers’ securities to trading prohibitions in US markets and subsequent delisting from US exchanges as early as 2024.
•
SEC Rules Governing Security-Based Swaps Transactions and Reporting: On December 15, 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (“SBS”) transactions, to prevent undue influence over Chief Compliance Officers of SBS dealers and major market participants and to require reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts.
•
SEC Proposed Rules on Private Fund Advisers: The SEC has recently proposed new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These include proposed amendments to Form PF for SEC-registered investment advisers that add new required disclosures to the form, require advisers to file reports within one business day for certain significant events, lower the threshold for large private equity adviser reporting and impose increased reporting obligations on large liquidity fund advisers. The SEC has also proposed additional rules that would, among other things, require registered private fund advisers to (i) provide quarterly reports to investors of fund performance, fees and expenses, (ii) obtain an annual audit for each fund and (iii) distribute to investors a fairness opinion and summary of certain material business relationships with the opinion provider in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction. In addition, the proposed rules would prohibit private fund advisers from engaging in certain activities and practices deemed to be contrary to the public interest and investor protection, providing certain types of preferential terms for selected investors and providing any other preferential treatment unless disclosed to current and prospective investors. These rules and amendments, if adopted as proposed, could significantly increase BlackRock’s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock’s alternatives products.
•
SEC Rule 15c2-11: SEC Rule 15c2-11 governs the submission of quotes into quotation systems by broker-dealers and has historically been applied to the OTC equity markets. However, the SEC recently stated that it intends to apply the rule to fixed income markets. The SEC staff also issued no-action relief in December 2021 setting out a phased implementation period for applying the rule to segments of the fixed income markets. While material impacts are not expected in Phase 1 of the implementation, Phase 2 may disrupt primary and secondary market liquidity.
•
Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS: In January 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of “exchange” and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules could impact certain functionality and tools offered by Aladdin and require ATS registration, which may increase compliance costs for BlackRock.
Regulatory reforms in the United States could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time- consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
BlackRock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the United States and the Company may be affected by several proposed or implemented reform initiatives in the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific regions, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives internationally, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, key reforms in these regions include:
European Union
•
EU Market Access and Outsourcing: In November 2021, the EU formally published legislative proposals amending both the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) and Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”) fund frameworks. The proposed changes remain broadly consistent with the current regulatory framework but with increased notification requirements to national regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), enhanced liquidity management requirements and new requirements for loan originating funds. There is a proposal that would require notification for instances of significant delegation of portfolio management or risk management functions to entities located outside the EU. ESMA would then be required to present market analysis and supervisory peer review every two years to the European Parliament. These proposals and any further regulatory actions could impact delegated activities, increase compliance costs and impact products and services offered to EU clients.
•
Revised Capital Requirements for Investment Firms: In June 2021, the Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for investment firms in scope of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive for investment firms proposed by the European Commission (the “EC”) came into effect, resulting in changes to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in the EU, changes to the method of calculating such capital and liquidity, and revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK has also adopted comparable rules, which have applied to UK-based investment firms from January 2022. Changes to the supervisory approach to assessing the risk of harm posed by BlackRock’s operations or asset management activities more broadly could increase the amount of regulatory capital and liquidity required to be held in the future, and the new rules impose other prudential requirements.

Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms: The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), proposed by the EC in September 2020 and currently going through the EU's ordinary legislative procedure, focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services. If enacted as proposed, DORA may, among other things: (i) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (ii) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. Separately, in November 2020, the FSB released a Consultation on Regulatory and Supervisory Issues Relating to Outsourcing and Third-Party Relationships, which explores direct supervision of technology service providers to financial services firms, in addition to detailing concerns around the potential for systemic risk in the provision of such services.

Central Securities Depository Regulation: Aspects of the settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation came into effect on February 1, 2022. These include rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions. However, the mandatory buy-in regime was delayed. Implementation of the regime required new operational mechanisms to facilitate compliance, which may increase resources and cost.

UK Divergence Reforms: Several UK regimes are currently subject to regulatory changes as the UK diverges from on-shored EU rules following the UK’s exit from the EU, including the Wholesale Markets Regime on MiFID and MiFIR frameworks, which is open to public consultation through 2022, and the regime for non-UK-based funds that are recognized for sale into the UK, which is currently under government review.
•
Conduct Regime: The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the application of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”) and a new Consumer Duty to all asset management firms, including BlackRock’s UK subsidiaries. The SMCR imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all Company staff in the UK and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities. The new Consumer Duty enhances duties on firms to take end-consumer duty interests into account when designing and managing retail products or services. Any failure to meet the FCA’s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock and its senior managers to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk.
Asia-Pacific
•
Regulatory Environment in China: The Company’s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company’s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on the transfer of the Company’s Chinese onshore data to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock’s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock’s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance.
International regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financial and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US and non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock’s shareholders, which could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.
In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.
Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may harm its business.
BlackRock’s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients, employees, shareholders and business partners. BlackRock’s reputation may be harmed by, among other factors, regulatory or enforcement actions, technology or operational failures, poor investment performance, ineffective management or monitoring of key third-party relationships, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, privacy incidents, employee errors or misconduct, a failure to manage ESG risks or a failure to manage conflicts of interest. In addition, BlackRock’s business, scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders. This heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity for BlackRock and may continue to do so in the future. For example, different stakeholder groups have divergent views on ESG matters, including in the countries in which BlackRock operates and invests, as well as states and localities where BlackRock serves public sector clients. This divergence increases the risk that any action or lack thereof on ESG will be perceived negatively by at least some stakeholders and adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business. BlackRock’s global presence and investments on behalf of its clients around the world could also lead to heightened scrutiny and criticism in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape. For example, BlackRock has received criticism from some stakeholders because of its investments in certain countries, including China, on behalf of clients. These criticisms have the potential to adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business. In addition, the increasing popularity of social media and non-mainstream Internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of any adverse publicity or inaccurate information about BlackRock, making effective remediation more difficult. Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may impact BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
A failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions and/or adversely affect BlackRock’s business and reputation, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
As a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients, the Company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. While BlackRock has policies, controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest, identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction, adverse publicity, litigation or enforcement actions. In particular, BlackRock’s broad range of investment, advisory and technology offerings, and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions, may result in clients working with multiple BlackRock businesses and/or BlackRock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. To the extent that BlackRock fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face adverse publicity, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, client attrition, penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
A subsidiary of BlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCC regulation and capital requirements that may limit its business activities. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank. Having a subsidiary subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to such limitations.
The implications of complying with threshold limits and/or any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation, impact the performance of certain BlackRock funds and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Of note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Moreover, as BlackRock’s business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory, industry-level or issuer-specific threshold limits that may prevent BlackRock from holding positions in certain equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds. Although BlackRock is actively engaged in regulatory, issuer-specific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity, threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may, in turn, impact the performance of certain BlackRock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds’ benchmarks and impact the performance of certain BlackRock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities.
BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the scale of our index investing business, as well as competition issues relating to the common ownership theory.
As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing. Commentators have argued that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. Additional commentary focuses on the common ownership theory, an academic theory stating that minority ownership of multiple companies within a single industry by the same investor leads to anticompetitive effects. This theory purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation and lower wages and employment rates, among other things. In the US, the FTC cited common ownership as a disqualifying factor in a proposed exemption from pre-merger notification rules and as a consideration underlying its consultation on rules applying to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities. In 2021, the FTC identified common ownership as a key enforcement area and passed a resolution empowering individual commissioners to investigate shareholder conduct in connection with common ownership. It is expected that common ownership may be given greater consideration in FTC investigations, studies, rule proposals, policy decisions and/or the scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions. The debate on common ownership is still on the agenda of competition regulators globally, and it is expected that common ownership may continue to be a consideration for the EC, among others, including in the assessment of mergers and investigations. For example, EC and European Parliament reports have suggested that more evidence was required on the impact of common ownership on competition, and a committee of the Australian House of Representatives held an inquiry on the implications of common ownership and capital concentration on Australian companies and markets. There is substantial literature casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with the common ownership theory and competition regulators, including the FTC, have acknowledged that the debate around the theory remains unsettled. Nevertheless, some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on the ownership stakes of common owners that, if enacted into policy, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, as well as increase costs and limit the availability of products for investors. Such policy solutions could, in turn, adversely affect BlackRock.
New tax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the EC has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.",,,,,6205.0,,0.0,15:15:26,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

COVID-19 Impact
BlackRock continues to actively monitor COVID-19 developments and their potential impact on the Company’s employees, business and operations, particularly in jurisdictions where BlackRock has significant employee populations and/or business activity. The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, including existing and new variants and its continued related impact on the global economy, affects BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and further duration of the pandemic and recovery period, the emergence and spread of additional variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, and the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks, and other third parties in response to the pandemic. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2022 (“2021 Form 10-K”), for further information on the possible future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.

Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity divided by total shares outstanding at March 31 of the respective period-end.
THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2021
GAAP. Operating income of $1,764 million increased $219 million and operating margin of 37.5% increased 240 bps from the first quarter of 2021. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected strong organic growth and higher technology services revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees and higher expense, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefits expense. Operating income and operating margin also reflected the impact of $178 million of product launch costs in the first quarter of 2021.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) decreased $37 million from the first quarter of 2021, driven primarily by mark-to-market losses on the Company’s un-hedged seed capital investments.
First quarter 2022 income tax expense included $133 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. First quarter 2021 income tax expense included $39 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. In addition, first quarter 2022 income tax expense included $18 million of net noncash tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.58, or 20%, from the first quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting higher operating income, a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by lower nonoperating income in the current quarter. The increase in earnings per diluted common share also included the impact of $178 million of product launch costs incurred in the first quarter of 2021.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,822 million increased $223 million and operating margin of 44.2% decreased 160 bps from the first quarter of 2021. The impact of product launch costs has been excluded from as adjusted operating margin for the first quarter of 2021.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.48, or 18%, from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher operating income, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by lower nonoperating income, in the current quarter. Income tax expense, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2022 excluded $18 million of net noncash tax benefits described above.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, to include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies. In addition, as previously reported in 2021, the Company recorded expense related to the lease of office space for its future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (“Lease cost - Hudson Yards”) from August 2021. While the Company expects to begin to occupy the new office space in late 2022 (and begin cash lease payments in May 2023), the Company was required to record lease expense when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. As a result, the Company is recognizing lease expense for both its current and future headquarters until its current headquarters lease expires in April 2023. Management believes removing Lease cost - Hudson Yards when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and enhances comparability among periods presented.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See note (1) above regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the updated presentation of non-GAAP expense adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions, as well as previously reported Lease cost - Hudson Yards.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

(4)
Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM decreased $441 billion to $9.57 trillion at March 31, 2022, driven by net market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by positive net inflows.
Long-term net inflows of $114 billion were comprised of net inflows of $56 billion, $47 billion and $10 billion into ETFs, institutional and retail, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $56 billion reflected growth from each of our major product categories, including core equity, sustainable and commodity ETFs. Equity net inflows of $41 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $8 billion reflected demand for treasuries, short duration inflation-linked, sustainable, municipal bond, and broad bond market ETFs.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $16 billion were led by continued growth in LifePath® target-date, alternatives and systematic active equity offerings.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $31 billion were led by $27 billion of equity net inflows and included approximately $70 billion from two large institutional clients.
•
Retail net inflows of $10 billion were positive in both the US and internationally, and reflected strength in equity, active multi-asset and liquid alternative funds.
Cash management AUM decreased to $725 billion, due to net outflows of $27 billion from offshore prime and US government money market funds.
Net market depreciation of $474 billion was primarily driven by global equity and fixed income market depreciation.
AUM decreased $53 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Euro.

(4)
Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM increased $562 billion to $9.57 trillion at March 31, 2022, driven by positive net inflows and net market appreciation, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $440 billion were comprised of net inflows of $293 billion, $76 billion and $71 billion from ETFs, retail and institutional, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $293 billion reflected positive flows across core equity, strategic and precision ETFs, and across asset classes. Equity net inflows of $198 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $85 billion were led by flows into treasuries, inflation-protected, municipal and core bond ETFs. By region, ETFs net inflows were diversified with $189 billion of net inflows in US-listed ETFs and $86 billion of net inflows in European-listed ETFs.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $169 billion included the previously disclosed impact of a significant outsourced chief investment officer (“OCIO”) mandate from a UK pension client in the second quarter of 2021 as well as a more recent significant active fixed income mandate from an insurance client and an OCIO mandate from an Asia-Pacific client. Net inflows also reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, illiquid alternatives and active equity strategies.
•
Institutional index net outflows of $98 billion included the previously discussed impact of a $58 billion low-fee institutional index redemption in the second quarter of 2021, as well as approximately $70 billion of net inflows from two large institutional clients in the first quarter of 2022. Equity net outflows of $111 billion were partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $14 billion.
•
Retail net inflows of $76 billion included net inflows of $45 billion and $31 billion in the US and internationally, respectively. Retail net inflows reflected strength in thematic and global equity and US growth equity funds, natural resources, unconstrained, municipal and total return fixed income funds, multi-asset and alternatives funds.
Cash management AUM increased to $725 billion, driven by net inflows of $28 billion.
Net market appreciation of $226 billion was driven by global equity market appreciation.
AUM decreased $118 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2021
Revenue increased $301 million, or 7%, from the three months ended March 31, 2021, driven by strong organic growth and 11% growth in technology services revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3,833 million increased $241 million from $3,592 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily driven by strong organic base fee growth. Securities lending revenue of $138 million increased from $127 million from the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily reflecting higher spreads and higher average balances of securities on loan.
Investment advisory performance fees of $98 million decreased $31 million from $129 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative and long-only products, partially offset by higher revenue from illiquid alternative products.
Technology services revenue of $341 million increased $35 million from $306 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2021
Expense increased $82 million from the three months ended March 31, 2021, largely driven by higher employee compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in general and administration expense, reflecting the impact of product launch costs incurred in the first quarter of 2021.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $89 million from the three months ended March 31, 2021, reflecting higher base compensation, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, driven in part by the lower mark-to-market impact of certain deferred compensation programs.
General and administration expense decreased $89 million from the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily driven by $178 million of product launch costs incurred in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by higher technology and marketing and promotional expense. The increase also reflected higher occupancy and office related expense, including $12 million of noncash occupancy expense related to the lease of office space for the Company’s future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (“Lease cost - Hudson Yards”), which it expects to begin to occupy in late 2022 (and begin lease payments in May 2023). Lease cost - Hudson Yards has been excluded from our “as adjusted” financial results. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items.

As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.

Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.
First quarter 2022 income tax expense included $133 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. In addition, first quarter 2022 GAAP income tax expense included $18 million of net noncash tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, which was excluded from our as adjusted results, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
First quarter 2021 income tax expense included $39 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products (“CIPs”).
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”), (collectively, “CIPs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2021 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 included $376 million and $308 million, respectively, of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended March 31, 2022).
Investments, including the impact of CIPs, increased $353 million from December 31, 2021 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $40 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets increased $3.3 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities).
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at March 31, 2022 decreased $1.8 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily due to 2021 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by 2022 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at March 31, 2022 increased $54 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased accruals. Other liabilities increased $3.3 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), and higher other liabilities of CIPs, including deferred carried interest liabilities. Net deferred income tax liabilities at March 31, 2022 increased $99 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $7.6 billion and $7.3 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 were $195 million and primarily reflected $147 million of purchases of property and equipment and $67 million of net investment purchases.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 were $1.7 billion, primarily resulting from $0.9 billion of share repurchases, including $0.5 billion in open market transactions and $0.4 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $0.8 billion of cash dividend payments.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements.

(2)
The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
Total liquidity resources decreased $1.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2021 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $0.9 billion and cash dividend payments of $0.8 billion, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities and a $300 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount under the credit facility.
A significant portion of the Company’s $6,288 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 0.6 million of common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $500 million. At March 31, 2022, there were approximately 3 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.3 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Borrowings
2022 Revolving Credit Facility. Since 2011, the Company has maintained an unsecured revolving credit facility which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the “2022 credit facility”). In March 2022, the 2022 credit facility was amended to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitment amount by $300 million to $4.7 billion, (ii) extend the maturity date to March 2027, (iii) change the rate for borrowings denominated in United States Dollars from a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) subject to certain adjustments and (iv) raise and/or add certain specified targets for the sustainability-linked pricing mechanics. The 2022 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2022 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.7 billion. The 2022 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2022, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2022 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2022 credit facility. At March 31, 2022, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-term Notes. At March 31, 2022, the principal amount of long-term notes outstanding was $7.5 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2021 Form 10-K for more information on overall borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company paid approximately $45 million of interest on long-term notes. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at March 31, 2022 were as follows:

The carrying value of the 2025 Notes is calculated using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of March 31, 2022.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At March 31, 2022, the Company had $844 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity funds and real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Critical Accounting Policies And Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgements and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgements, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2021 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it a) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and b) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. As of March 31, 2022, the Company was deemed to be the PB of 73 VIEs. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Fair Value Disclosures, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold at the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or b) distribute their sales proceeds and determine the timing of such distributions.
The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 16, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.","Item 1A.

COVID-19 Impact
BlackRock continues to actively monitor COVID-19 developments and their potential impact on the Company’s employees, business and operations, particularly in jurisdictions where BlackRock has significant employee populations and/or business activity. The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, including existing and new variants and its continued related impact on the global economy, affects BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and further duration of the pandemic and recovery period, the emergence and spread of additional variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, and the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks, and other third parties in response to the pandemic. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2022 (“2021 Form 10-K”), for further information on the possible future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity divided by total shares outstanding at June 30 of the respective period-end.
THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
GAAP. Operating income of $1,668 million decreased $263 million and operating margin of 36.9% decreased 320 bps from the second quarter of 2021. Decreases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the impact of significantly lower markets, the negative impact of foreign exchange movements and lower performance fees, partially offset by organic base fee growth, the elimination of yield-related fee waivers on money market funds, higher technology services revenue and lower expense. Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) decreased $334 million from the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by mark-to-market losses on the Company’s un-hedged seed capital, co-investment portfolios and certain minority investments.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $1.86, or 21%, from the second quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting lower operating and nonoperating income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Second quarter 2021 income tax expense included $171 million of noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,727 million decreased $289 million and operating margin of 43.7% decreased 320 bps from the second quarter of 2021. Earnings per diluted common share decreased $3.09, or 30%, from the second quarter of 2021. Income tax expense, as adjusted, for the second quarter 2021 excluded $171 million of noncash net expense described above.
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 COMPARED WITH SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
GAAP. Operating income of $3,432 million decreased $44 million and operating margin of 37.2% decreased 50 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2021. Decreases in operating income and operating margin reflected lower performance fees and higher volume related expense, partially offset by higher investment advisory and administration fees (collectively “base fees”), higher technology services revenue, lower employee compensation and benefits expense and lower general and administration expense, including the impact of $178 million of product launch costs incurred in 2021.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI decreased $371 million from the six months ended June 30, 2021, driven primarily by mark-to-market losses on the Company’s un-hedged seed capital, co-investment portfolios and certain minority investments during the six months ended June 30, 2022.
Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reflected $133 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2022 and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters, and $18 million of net noncash tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 included $171 million of noncash net expense described above and $39 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2021. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $0.26 or 2%, from the six months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting lower operating and nonoperating income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $3,549 million decreased $66 million and operating margin of 43.9% decreased 250 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2021. The impact of product launch costs has been excluded from as adjusted operating margin for the six months ended June 30, 2021.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $1.60, or 9%, from the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily driven by lower nonoperating income in the six months ended June 30, 2022. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 excluded the $18 million net noncash benefit and the $171 million net noncash expense, respectively, described above.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•
Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, to include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies. In addition, as previously reported in 2021, the Company recorded expense related to the lease of office space for its future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (“Lease cost - Hudson Yards”) from August 2021. While the Company expects to begin to occupy the new office space in late 2022 (and begin cash lease payments in May 2023), the Company was required to record lease expense when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. As a result, the Company is recognizing lease expense for both its current and future headquarters until its current headquarters lease expires in April 2023. Management believes removing Lease cost - Hudson Yards when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and enhances comparability among periods presented.
•
Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•
Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See note (1) above regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the updated presentation of non-GAAP expense adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions, as well as previously reported Lease cost - Hudson Yards.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.
ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT
AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

AUM decreased $1.08 trillion to $8.49 trillion at June 30, 2022, driven by net market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by net inflows.
Long-term net inflows of $69 billion were comprised of net inflows of $52 billion and $26 billion into ETFs and institutional, respectively, partially offset by $10 billion of retail outflows. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $52 billion reflected growth from each of our major product categories, including core equity, strategic, and precision ETFs. Fixed income net inflows of $31 billion reflected demand for treasuries, short duration, inflation-linked, sustainable and municipal bond ETFs. Equity net inflows of $23 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $21 billion were led by $20 billion of fixed income net inflows reflecting continued strength in liability-driven investment (“LDI”) solutions.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were led by growth in systematic active equity, illiquid alternatives, LifePath target-date funds and outsourced chief investment officer (“OCIO”) solutions, partially offset by fixed income net outflows.
•
Retail net outflows of $10 billion reflected industry pressures in active fixed income and world allocation strategies, partially offset by strength in index separately managed accounts (“SMAs”), municipal bonds and our systematic multi-strategy alternatives fund.
Cash management AUM increased to $739 billion, driven by US government mandates and included inflows from Circle Internet Financial as the Company became the primary manager of their USD Coin cash reserves.
Net market depreciation of $1 trillion was primarily driven by global equity and fixed income market depreciation.
AUM decreased $171 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Euro.

Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing seven months.
(3)
Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.
(4)
Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM decreased $1.52 trillion to $8.49 trillion at June 30, 2022, driven by net market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by net inflows.
Long-term net inflows of $182 billion were comprised of net inflows of $108 billion and $74 billion into ETFs and institutional, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $108 billion reflected growth from each of our major product categories, including core equity, strategic, and precision ETFs. Equity net inflows of $64 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $39 billion reflected demand for treasuries, short duration, sustainable, and municipal bond ETFs.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $52 billion were led by $29 billion of equity net inflows, including approximately $70 billion from two large institutional clients during the first quarter of 2022, and $24 billion of fixed income inflows reflecting continued strength in LDI solutions.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $22 billion were led by growth in systematic active equity, illiquid alternatives, LifePath target-date funds and OCIO solutions.
Cash management AUM decreased to $739 billion, due to net outflows of $6 billion and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements of $9 billion.
Net market depreciation of $1.5 trillion was primarily driven by global equity and fixed income market depreciation.
AUM decreased $224 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Euro.

Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
(3)
Advisory AUM represents mandates linked to purchases and disposition of assets and portfolios on behalf of official institutions and long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.
(4)
Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM decreased $1 trillion to $8.49 trillion at June 30, 2022, driven by net market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by net inflows.
Long-term net inflows of $449 billion were comprised of net inflows of $270 billion, $135 billion and $44 billion from ETFs, institutional, and retail respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•
ETFs net inflows of $270 billion reflected positive flows across core equity, strategic and precision ETFs, and across asset classes. Equity net inflows of $170 billion were driven by both US and international equity market exposures. Fixed income net inflows of $94 billion were led by flows into treasuries, inflation-protected, municipal and core bond ETFs.
•
Institutional active net inflows of $131 billion included the previously disclosed impact of a significant active fixed income mandate from an insurance client in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an OCIO mandate from an Asia-Pacific client in the third quarter of 2021. Net inflows also reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date funds, illiquid alternatives and systematic active equity strategies.
•
Institutional index net inflows of $4 billion reflected $30 billion of fixed income net inflows, including $70 billion from two large clients in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by equity net outflows of $25 billion.
•
Retail net inflows of $44 billion included net inflows of $27 billion and $17 billion in the US and internationally, respectively. Retail net inflows reflected strength in thematic and global equity and US growth equity funds, natural resources, unconstrained, municipal and total return fixed income funds, multi-asset and alternatives funds.
Cash management AUM increased to $739 billion, driven by net inflows of $26 billion partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Net market depreciation of $1.2 trillion was driven by global equity and fixed income market depreciation.
AUM decreased $297 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2021
Revenue decreased $294 million, or 6%, from the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily driven by the impact of significantly lower markets and US dollar appreciation on average AUM and lower performance fees.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3,688 million decreased $69 million from $3,757 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily driven by the negative impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by organic base fee growth, the elimination of yield-related fee waivers on money market funds, and higher securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $160 million increased from $140 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily reflecting higher spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $106 million decreased $234 million from $340 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily reflecting lower revenue from alternative and long-only products.
Technology services revenue of $332 million increased $16 million from $316 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting continued strong client demand for Aladdin, despite the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2021
Revenue increased $7 million from the six months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting higher base fees, technology services revenue and securities lending revenue, largely offset by lower performance fees.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $7,521 million increased $172 million from $7,349 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily driven by strong organic base fee growth, the elimination of yield-related fee waivers on money market funds, and higher securities lending revenue, partially offset by the negative impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM. Securities lending revenue of $298 million increased $31 million from $267 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily reflecting higher spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $204 million decreased $265 million from $469 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative and long-only products.
Technology services revenue of $673 million increased $51 million from $622 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin, despite the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2021
Expense decreased $31 million from the three months ended June 30, 2021, largely driven by lower employee compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by higher general and administration expense.
Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $134 million from the three months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting lower incentive compensation, due to lower operating income and performance fees, and lower deferred compensation driven in part by the lower mark-to-market impact of certain deferred cash compensation programs, partially offset by higher base compensation.
General and administration expense increased $69 million from the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily driven by higher marketing and promotional expense, resulting from higher travel and entertainment expense, and higher technology expense. The increase also reflected higher occupancy and office related expense, including $15 million of noncash occupancy expense related to the lease of office space for the Company’s future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (“Lease cost - Hudson Yards”), which it expects to begin to occupy in late 2022 (and begin lease payments in May 2023). Lease cost - Hudson Yards has been excluded from our “as adjusted” financial results. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2021
Expense increased $51 million from the six months ended June 30, 2021, largely driven by higher volume-related expense, partially offset by lower employee compensation and benefits expense and lower general and administration expense, including the impact of product launch costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2021.
Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $45 million from the six months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees, and lower deferred compensation driven in part by the lower mark-to-market impact of certain deferred cash compensation programs, partially offset by higher base compensation.
General and administration expense decreased $20 million from the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily driven by $178 million of product launch costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2021, partially offset by higher technology expense and higher marketing and promotional expense, resulting from higher travel and entertainment expense. General and administration expense also reflected higher occupancy and office related expense, including $27 million of Lease cost - Hudson Yards described above.

As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.

Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.
2022. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included $133 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. In addition, GAAP income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included $18 million of net noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, which was excluded from our as adjusted results, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
2021. Income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 included $171 million of noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate, which was excluded from our as adjusted results, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 also reflected $39 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2021.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”) (collectively, “CIPs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2021 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 included $318 million and $308 million, respectively, of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended June 30, 2022).
Accounts receivable at June 30, 2022 decreased $318 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower base and performance fee receivables, partially offset by an increase in technology services receivables. Investments, including the impact held by CIPs, increased $40 million from December 31, 2021 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $81 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets increased $1.4 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities).
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at June 30, 2022 decreased $1.5 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily due to 2021 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by 2022 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at June 30, 2022 decreased $73 million from December 31, 2021. Borrowings at June 30, 2022 decreased $811 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to repayments of borrowings of $750 million. Other liabilities increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), and higher other liabilities held by CIPs, including deferred carried interest liabilities. Net deferred income tax liabilities at June 30, 2022 increased $43 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation partially offset by unrealized investment losses.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $7.3 billion at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIPs:

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the six months ended June 30, 2022 were $495 million and primarily reflected $266 million of net investment purchases and $263 million of purchases of property and equipment.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the six months ended June 30, 2022 were $3.7 billion, primarily resulting from $1.5 billion of cash dividend payments, $1.4 billion of share repurchases, including $1 billion in open market transactions and $0.4 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $0.8 billion of repayments of borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Liquidity resources at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows:

The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s US subsidiaries was approximately 45% and 50% at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.
Total liquidity resources decreased $2.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2021 year-end incentive awards, cash dividend payments of $1.5 billion, share repurchases of $1.4 billion and $0.8 billion of repayments of borrowings, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities and a $300 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount under the credit facility.
A significant portion of the Company’s $6.1 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 1.4 million of common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $1 billion. At June 30, 2022, there were approximately 2.2 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Borrowings
2022 Revolving Credit Facility. Since 2011, the Company has maintained an unsecured revolving credit facility which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the “2022 credit facility”). In March 2022, the 2022 credit facility was amended to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitment amount by $300 million to $4.7 billion, (ii) extend the maturity date to March 2027, (iii) change the rate for borrowings denominated in US dollars from a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) subject to certain adjustments and (iv) raise and/or add certain specified targets for the sustainability-linked pricing mechanics. The 2022 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2022 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.7 billion. The 2022 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2022, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2022 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2022 credit facility. At June 30, 2022, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-term Notes. At June 30, 2022, the principal amount of long-term notes outstanding was $6.7 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2021 Form 10-K for more information on overall borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
In June 2022, the Company fully repaid $750 million of 3.375% notes at maturity.
During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company paid approximately $95 million of interest on long-term notes. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at June 30, 2022 were as follows:

Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At June 30, 2022, the Company had $806 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity funds and real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Critical Accounting Policies And Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2021 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it a) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and b) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. As of June 30, 2022, the Company was deemed to be the PB of 80 VIEs. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Fair Value Disclosures, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold at the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgment is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or b) distribute their sales proceeds and determine the timing of such distributions.
The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 16, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.","Item 1A.

COVID-19 Impact
BlackRock continues to actively monitor COVID-19 developments and their potential impact on the Company’s employees, business and operations, particularly in jurisdictions where BlackRock has significant employee populations and/or business activity. The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, including existing and new variants and its continued related impact on the global economy, affects BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and further duration of the pandemic and recovery period, the emergence and spread of additional variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, and the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks, and other third parties in response to the pandemic. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2022 (“2021 Form 10-K”), for further information on the possible future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
(1)As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.
(2)Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity divided by total shares outstanding at September 30 of the respective period-end.
Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2021
GAAP. Operating income of $1.5 billion decreased $409 million and operating margin of 35.4% decreased 290 bps from the three months ended September 30, 2021. Decreases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the impact of significantly lower markets, the negative impact of foreign exchange movements and lower performance fees, partially offset by lower expense. Decreases in operating income and operating margin also included the impact of $96 million of product launch costs associated with the September 2021 close of the BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Trust.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) decreased $54 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021, driven primarily by mark-to-market losses on the Company’s un-hedged seed capital, co-investment portfolios and certain minority investments, partially offset by higher noncash gains related to our strategic minority investment in iCapital Network, Inc. (“iCapital”).
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $1.64, or 15%, from the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting lower operating and nonoperating income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter. The three months ended September 30, 2022 income tax expense included approximately $93 million of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1.6 billion decreased $440 million and operating margin of 42.0% decreased 560 bps from the three months ended September 30, 2021. The impact of product launch costs has been excluded from as adjusted operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Earnings per diluted common share decreased $1.79, or 16%, from the three months ended September 30, 2021.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021
GAAP. Operating income of $5.0 billion decreased $453 million and operating margin of 36.6% decreased 130 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Decreases in operating income and operating margin reflected lower performance fees and lower investment advisory and administration fees (collectively “base fees”), driven by the impact of significantly lower markets and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by higher technology services revenue and lower expense, including the impact of $274 million of product launch costs incurred in 2021.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI decreased $425 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2021, driven primarily by mark-to-market losses on the Company’s un-hedged seed capital, co-investment portfolios and certain minority investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, partially offset by higher noncash gains related to our strategic minority investment in iCapital during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 reflected $226 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2022 and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters, and $18 million of net noncash tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included $171 million of noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom (""UK"") increasing its corporate tax rate, and $42 million of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2021. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $1.92 or 7%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting lower operating and nonoperating income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $5.1 billion decreased $506 million and operating margin of 43.3% decreased 350 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The impact of product launch costs has been excluded from as adjusted operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $3.40, or 11%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting lower operating and nonoperating income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 excluded the $18 million net noncash benefit and the $171 million net noncash expense, respectively, described above.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.
Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:
(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:
Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of
revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, to include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies. In addition, as previously reported in 2021, the Company recorded expense related to the lease of office space for its future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (“Lease cost - Hudson Yards”) from August 2021. While the Company expects to begin to occupy the new office space in late 2022 (and begin cash lease payments in May 2023), the Company was required to record lease expense when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. As a result, the Company is recognizing lease expense for both its current and future headquarters until its current headquarters lease expires in April 2023. Management believes removing Lease cost - Hudson Yards when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and enhances comparability among periods presented.
•Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.
(2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted:
Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See note (1) above regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the updated presentation of non-GAAP expense adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions, as well as previously reported Lease cost - Hudson Yards.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2021
Revenue decreased $739 million, or 15%, from the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily driven by the impact of significantly lower markets and US dollar appreciation on average AUM and lower performance fees.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3.5 billion decreased $412 million from $3.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily driven by the negative impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by organic base fee growth over the last twelve months and the elimination of yield-related fee waivers on money market funds. Securities lending revenue of $162 million increased from $152 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting higher spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $82 million decreased $263 million from $345 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative products, including lower fees from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter.
Technology services revenue of $338 million increased $18 million from $320 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin, despite the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021
Revenue decreased $732 million, or 5%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2021, largely driven by lower base and performance fees, partially offset by higher technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $11.1 billion decreased $240 million from $11.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily driven by the negative impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by organic base fee growth, the elimination of yield-related fee waivers on money market funds, and higher securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $460 million increased $41 million from $419 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting higher spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $286 million decreased $528 million from $814 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative and long-only products.
Technology services revenue of $1.0 billion increased $69 million from $942 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin, despite the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Expense
Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2021
Expense decreased $330 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting lower employee compensation and benefits expense, direct fund expense, and general and administration expense, including the impact of product launch costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2021.
Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $188 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees, partially offset by higher base compensation.
Direct fund expense decreased $36 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily reflecting lower average AUM.
General and administration expense decreased $57 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily driven by the impact of $96 million of product launch costs in the three months ended September 30, 2021 and lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments in the three months ended September 30, 2022, partially offset by higher marketing and promotional expense, including the impact of higher travel and entertainment expense, and higher technology expense.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021
Expense decreased $279 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2021, largely driven by lower employee compensation and benefits expense and general and administration expense, including the impact of product launch costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $233 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income, performance fees and deferred compensation driven in part by the lower mark-to-market impact of certain deferred cash compensation programs, partially offset by higher base compensation.
General and administration expense decreased $77 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily driven by $274 million of product launch costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments in the three months ended September 30, 2022, partially offset by higher marketing and promotional expense, resulting from higher travel and entertainment expense, and higher technology expense. General and administration expense also reflected higher occupancy and office related expense, including higher noncash occupancy expense related to the lease of office space for the Company’s future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York, which it expects to begin to occupy in late 2022 (and begin lease payments in May 2023). Lease cost - Hudson Yards has been excluded from our “as adjusted” financial results. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on other non-GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.
(3)Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to credit funds, direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions.
(4)Amounts primarily include mark-to-market net gains (losses) related to unhedged equity, fixed income and multi-asset seed investments.
(5)The amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 primarily include nonoperating noncash pre-tax gains in connection with its strategic minority investment in iCapital of approximately $267 million and $107 million, respectively. The amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 also include nonoperating noncash pre-tax gains in connection with strategic minority investments in Scalable Capital Limited of approximately $46 million. Additional amounts primarily include noncash pre-tax gains (losses) related to the revaluation of certain minority investments.
Income Tax Expense
(1)As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022.
(2)Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.
2022. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 included approximately $93 million of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included $139 million of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters and $87 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2022. In addition, GAAP income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included $18 million of net noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, which was excluded from our as adjusted results, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") was enacted into law, which introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on net stock repurchases. The Company is evaluating the impacts of these provisions but currently does not expect the IRA to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements when the law becomes effective on January 1, 2023.
2021. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included $171 million of noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, also reflected $42 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2021.
The as adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, excluded the impact of $171 million noncash deferred tax revaluation expense mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”) (collectively, “CIPs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2021 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.
(1)Amounts represent segregated client assets and related liabilities, in which BlackRock has no economic interest. BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
(2)Amounts represent the impact of consolidating CIPs.
(3)Amount includes property and equipment and other assets.
(4)Amount includes approximately $4.4 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles.
The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 included $326 million and $308 million, respectively, of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended September 30, 2022).
Accounts receivable at September 30, 2022 decreased $428 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower base and performance fee receivables, partially offset by an increase in technology services receivables. Investments, including the impact held by CIPs, at September 30, 2022 decreased $355 million from December 31, 2021 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets at September 30, 2022 decreased $121 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets at September 30, 2022 increased $2.7 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities).
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at September 30, 2022 decreased $1.2 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily due to 2021 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by 2022 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at September 30, 2022 increased $204 million from December 31, 2021. Borrowings at September 30, 2022 decreased $855 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to repayments of $750 million. Other liabilities at September 30, 2022 increased $1.9 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets). Net deferred income tax liabilities at September 30, 2022 decreased $63 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with unrealized investment losses.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $6.9 billion and $7.3 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.
(1)Amounts included $1.5 billion of carried interest (VIEs) as of both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure.
(2)Amounts exclude investments in strategic minority investments included in other assets on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021:
(1)Equity includes unhedged seed investments in equity mutual funds/strategies.
(2)Fixed income includes unhedged seed investments in fixed income mutual funds/strategies and bank loans.
(3)Multi-asset includes unhedged seed investments in multi-asset mutual funds/strategies.
(4)Other alternatives primarily include co-investments in direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions.
As adjusted investment activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was as follows:
(1)Amount includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.
(2)Amount includes the impact of foreign exchange movements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIPs:
Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $666 million and primarily reflected $326 million of net investment purchases and $399 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $59 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $4.8 billion, primarily resulting from $2.3 billion of cash dividend payments, $1.8 billion of share repurchases, including $1.4 billion in open market transactions and $0.4 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $0.8 billion of repayments of borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Liquidity resources at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows:
(1)The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
(2)The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s US subsidiaries was approximately 50% at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.
Total liquidity resources decreased $2.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2021 year-end incentive awards, cash dividend payments of $2.3 billion, share repurchases of $1.8 billion and $0.8 billion of repayments of borrowings, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities and a $0.3 billion increase in the aggregate commitment amount under the credit facility.
A significant portion of the Company’s $5.9 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company repurchased 2.0 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $1.4 billion. At September 30, 2022, there were approximately 1.7 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Borrowings
2022 Revolving Credit Facility. Since 2011, the Company has maintained an unsecured revolving credit facility which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the “2022 credit facility”). In March 2022, the 2022 credit facility was amended to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitment amount by $300 million to $4.7 billion, (ii) extend the maturity date to March 2027, (iii) change the rate for borrowings denominated in US dollars from a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) subject to certain adjustments and (iv) raise and/or add certain specified targets for the sustainability-linked pricing mechanics. The 2022 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2022 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.7 billion. The 2022 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2022 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2022 credit facility. At September 30, 2022, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-term Notes. At September 30, 2022, the principal amount of long-term notes outstanding was $6.6 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2021 Form 10-K for more information on overall borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
In June 2022, the Company fully repaid $750 million of 3.375% notes at maturity.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company paid approximately $146 million of interest on long-term notes. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at September 30, 2022 were as follows:
(1)The carrying value of the 2025 Notes is calculated using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of September 30, 2022.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At September 30, 2022, the Company had $861 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity funds and real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Critical Accounting Policies And Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2021 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (a) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (b) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. As of September 30, 2022, the Company was deemed to be the PB of 88 VIEs. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Fair Value Disclosures, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain SMAs. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold at the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgment is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to (a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or (b) distribute their sales proceeds and determine the timing of such distributions.
The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed
consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.5 billion of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 16, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.","Item 1A.

Management seeks to deliver value for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on BlackRock’s differentiated competitive position, including:
•the Company’s longstanding model of client choice, through which it offers a wide range of index, active, and whole portfolio solutions across broad markets, themes, regions, and investment styles;
•the Company's focus on strong investment performance, seeking the best risk-adjusted returns for client portfolios, within the mandates given by clients, to help them meet their investment objectives;
•the Company's research, data and analytics, which are at the center of BlackRock's investment approach and processes. They inform BlackRock's pursuit of the best risk-adjusted returns, and underpin product creation and innovation;
•the Company’s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 50% of employees outside the United States (""US"") serving clients locally and supporting local investment capabilities. Approximately 40% of total AUM is managed for clients domiciled outside the US;
•the Company’s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and industry trends including the secular shift to index investing and ETFs, growing allocations to private markets, increasing demand for outsourcing, anticipated re-allocations to fixed income, demand for high-performing active strategies, interest in sustainable investment strategies and whole portfolio solutions using index, active and illiquid alternatives products; and a continued focus on income and retirement; and
•the Company’s longstanding commitment to innovation, technology services and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock technology products and solutions, including Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, and Cachematrix.

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace impacted by changing market dynamics and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.
The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in Aladdin and other technology products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives, in a manner consistent with their risk preferences, to deliver excellent client service and to innovate in technology to serve clients’ evolving needs. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain qualified professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for all prior periods to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information on non-GAAP financial measures and as adjusted items, see Item 7.

Ltd. to the DSP Group in August 2018 (“DSP Transaction”), and (d) net AUM from the acquisition of Aperio Group, LLC (“Aperio Transaction”) in February 2021.
(2)Percentage represents CAGR over a five-year period (December 31, 2017 - December 31, 2022).
AUM represents the broad range of financial assets managed for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which BlackRock provides risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that the Company is retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.
Investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. BlackRock also earns performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, the Company also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, implementation go-lives and software solution delivery and support.
At December 31, 2022, total AUM was $8.6 trillion, representing a CAGR of 6% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including the net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction, which added $27.5 billion of AUM in 2018, and the Aperio Transaction, which added $41.3 billion of AUM in February 2021. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.
The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:

Client Type
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, with a regionally focused business model. BlackRock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment, risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent.
Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.
ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections.

Retail
BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the investment spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors.

In the aggregate, active and index mutual funds totaled $660 billion, or approximately 80%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. Approximately 80% of retail long-term AUM is invested in active products.

The retail client base is diversified geographically, with 69% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 26% in EMEA and 5% in Asia-Pacific at year-end 2022.
•US retail long-term net outflows of $9 billion were driven by outflows from fixed income and multi-asset of $16 billion and $4 billion, respectively, partially offset by equity and alternatives net inflows of $8 billion, and $3 billion, respectively. Fixed income net outflows were primarily due to net outflows from unconstrained and high yield bond funds. Multi-asset net outflows were driven by world allocation and multi-asset income strategies. Alternatives net inflows were led by multi-strategy credit and tactical opportunities funds, and equity net inflows reflect continued growth in Aperio, BlackRock’s customized index equity solution.
•International retail long-term net outflows of $10 billion were driven by equity net outflows of $8 billion, reflecting outflows from European equities and index equity. Fixed income net outflows of $4 billion were primarily due to net outflows from short duration, Asian and high yield bond strategies. Alternatives and multi-asset net inflows were $1 billion, and $716 million, respectively.
ETFs
BlackRock is the leading ETF provider in the world with $2.9 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2022, and generated net inflows of $220 billion in 2022. The majority of ETF AUM and net inflows represent the Company’s index-tracking iShares-branded ETFs. The Company also offers a select number of active BlackRock-branded ETFs that seek outperformance and/or differentiated outcomes.
Record fixed income ETF net inflows of $123 billion were diversified across exposures, led by flows into treasury, investment grade, and municipal ETFs. Equity ETF net inflows of $101 billion were driven by flows into core, sustainable and thematic ETFs, as well as continued client use of BlackRock’s broad-based precision exposure ETFs to express risk preferences and make tactical allocation changes during the year. Multi-asset ETFs saw net inflows of $1 billion, while alternative ETFs had net outflows of $5 billion, primarily driven by commodities funds.
ETFs represented 37% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2022 and 42% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.

Institutional active AUM ended 2022 at $1.6 trillion, reflecting $169 billion of net inflows, driven by the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates and continued growth in our LifePath® target-date, quantitative equity and private markets platforms.
Fixed income net inflows of $115 billion reflected the funding of a significant insurance client outsourcing mandate. Multi-asset and equity net inflows of $34 billion and $10 billion, respectively, reflected continued growth in LifePath target-date offerings and our quantitative equity strategies, respectively.
Alternatives net inflows of $10 billion were led by private credit, infrastructure and private equity. Excluding return of capital and investment of $12 billion, alternatives net inflows were $22 billion. In addition, 2022 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, with BlackRock raising $35 billion of client capital. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $34 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments to deploy for institutional clients, which is not included in AUM.
Institutional active represented 21% of long-term AUM and 19% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.
Institutional index AUM totaled $2.5 trillion at December 31, 2022, reflecting $24 billion of inflows, driven by fixed income.
Institutional index represented 32% of long-term AUM and 7% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.
The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:
•Pensions, Foundations and Endowments BlackRock is among the world’s largest managers of pension plan assets with $2.6 trillion, or 62%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2022. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, and our defined contribution channel represented $1.2 trillion of total pension AUM. BlackRock remains well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $80 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.
•Official Institutions BlackRock managed $259 billion, or 6%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2022. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.
•Financial and Other Institutions BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $570 billion, or 14%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end 2022. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which the Company provides sub-advisory services, totaled $695 billion, or 16%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Long-term product offerings include active and index strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index products include both our non-ETF index products and ETFs.
Although many clients use both active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.
Equity
Year-end 2022 equity AUM totaled $4.4 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $105 billion. Net inflows included $101 billion and $7 billion into ETFs and non-ETF index, respectively, partially offset by active net outflows of $3 billion.
BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate.
Equity represented 56% of long-term AUM and 52% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.
Fixed Income
Fixed income AUM ended 2022 at $2.6 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $250 billion. Net inflows included $123 billion, $93 billion and $34 billion into ETFs, active and non-ETF index, respectively. Record fixed income ETF net inflows of $123 billion reflected the benefit of our diverse product offering and included strong flows into treasury, investment grade and municipal ETFs. Active fixed income net inflows included the funding of a significant insurance client outsourcing mandate.
Fixed income represented 32% of long-term AUM and 26% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.
Multi-Asset
BlackRock manages a variety of multi-asset funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions may include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.
Multi-asset represented 9% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.

Multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $33 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed $19 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2022, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings.
The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:
•Target date and target risk products generated net inflows of $24 billion. Institutional investors represented 89% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 84% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation overlay model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products.
•Asset allocation and balanced products generated $6 billion of net inflows. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families.
•Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.
Alternatives
BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into three main categories - (1) illiquid alternatives, (2) liquid alternatives, and (3) currency and commodities. Illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions, private equity, opportunistic and credit, real estate and infrastructure. Liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds).
In 2022, liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined $14 billion of net inflows, or $28 billion excluding return of capital/investment of $14 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital/investment were opportunistic and credit strategies, private equity solutions and infrastructure. Net inflows were driven by opportunistic and credit strategies, infrastructure and private equity. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $34 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying. Currency and commodities saw $7 billion of net outflows, primarily from commodities ETFs and institutional separate accounts.
BlackRock believes that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. BlackRock’s highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to continue to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.
Alternatives represented 3% of long-term AUM and 12% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.

(1)Return of capital/investment is included in outflows.
(2)Amount represents client assets that are uninvested commitments, which are currently non-fee paying and are not included in AUM. These commitments are expected to generate fees and will be counted in AUM and flows as the capital is deployed over time.
Illiquid Alternatives
The Company’s illiquid alternatives strategies include the following:
•Alternative Solutions represents highly customized portfolios of alternative investments. In 2022, alternative solutions portfolios had $7 billion in AUM, and $895 million of net inflows.
•Private Equity and Opportunistic included AUM of $25 billion in opportunistic and credit offerings, $22 billion in private equity solutions, and $7 billion in Long Term Private Capital (“LTPC”). Net inflows of $9 billion into private equity and opportunistic strategies included $6 billion of net inflows into opportunistic and credit offerings, $2 billion of net inflows into private equity solutions and $844 million of net inflows into LTPC.
•Real Assets which includes infrastructure and real estate, totaled $58 billion in AUM, reflecting net inflows of $6 billion, led by infrastructure.
Liquid Alternatives
The Company’s liquid alternatives products’ net outflows of $2 billion reflected net outflows from direct hedge fund strategies. Direct hedge fund strategies includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings.
In addition, the Company manages $86 billion in liquid credit strategies which is included in active fixed income.
Currency and Commodities
The Company’s currency and commodities products include a range of active and index products.
Currency and commodities products had $7 billion of net outflows, primarily driven by ETFs and institutional separate accounts. ETF commodities products represented $61 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.
Cash Management
Cash management AUM totaled $671 billion at December 31, 2022, reflecting $77 billion of net outflows, primarily due to institutional client redemptions from US government money market funds. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds, short-term investment funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs, New Zealand dollars or British pounds.
During 2022 BlackRock voluntarily waived a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a minimum level of daily net investment income. These waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $72 million, which was partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock’s distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. These waivers ceased following rate hikes by the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve in March 2022. BlackRock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of yield support waivers in future periods. For more information see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.

Americas
Americas net inflows of $147 billion were driven by the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates, and reflected net inflows into fixed income, multi-asset, equity, and alternatives of $174 billion, $31 billion, $23 billion, and $5 billion, respectively. These were partially offset by cash and advisory net outflows of $77 billion and $9 billion, respectively. Advisory net outflows of $9 billion were primarily linked to the successful planned wind-downs of portfolios managed by our Financial Markets Advisory group on behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of NY. Revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the “Advisory and other revenue” line item on the Income Statement. During the year, BlackRock served clients through offices in 36 states in the US as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and the Dominican Republic.
The Americas represented 67% of total AUM and 65% of total base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.
EMEA
EMEA net inflows of $74 billion were driven by fixed income and alternatives net inflows of $73 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Offerings include fund families in the United Kingdom (""UK""), the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Dublin and ETFs listed on stock exchanges throughout Europe, as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products.
EMEA represented 25% of total AUM and 29% of total base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.
Asia-Pacific
Asia-Pacific net inflows of $86 billion were primarily due to equity and fixed income net inflows of $85 billion and $3 billion, respectively. Clients in the Asia-Pacific region are served through offices in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, China, and India.
Asia-Pacific represented 8% of total AUM and 6% of total base fees and securities lending revenue for 2022.

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, providing an end-to-end, SaaS solution for investment and risk management for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional and retail investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via Aladdin Risk, as well as investment accounting capabilities. Aladdin Provider is a tool used by asset servicers, connecting them to the platform used by asset managers and owners to add operational efficiency. In 2019, BlackRock acquired eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider to enable clients to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. eFront is offered to clients both as a standalone offering and as part of an integrated “Whole Portfolio View” solution that provides transparency across clients’ public and private assets. Building on eFront’s industry-leading tools for private asset classes, Aladdin was an early mover to provide data transparency and analytics across public and private assets with over forty clients using the Whole Portfolio View capabilities. Through our Cachematrix platform, BlackRock is also a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform.
BlackRock offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering personalized digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities.
At year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Australia.
Technology services revenue of $1.4 billion was up 6% year-over-year, and annual contract value (“ACV”) increased 8% year-over-year. ACV growth was driven by record net sales of Aladdin in 2022, with about half of new client mandates spanning multiple Aladdin products. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue. At the end of any period, BlackRock generally has recurring revenue contracts in place for a large portion of total annual revenue. BlackRock measures the fees related to these agreements and refers to this as ACV. For further information on ACV, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions across public and private markets. Approximately 25% of Aladdin’s revenue was denominated in non-US currencies. In addition, while Aladdin is a multi-asset system, the majority of positions managed on the platform are fixed income. 2022 technology services revenue growth reflected headwinds associated with the foreign exchange impact on Aladdin’s non-dollar revenue and bond market declines on Aladdin’s fixed income platform assets.
BlackRock is focused on enhancing Aladdin, with continued investment into areas such as whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and sustainable investing solutions. BlackRock continues to evolve and enable clients to further simplify their operating infrastructure with Aladdin. Clients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to meet their specific needs, and BlackRock is providing them with choice and flexibility. BlackRock is creating connectivity with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions, which include asset servicers, cloud providers, digital asset platforms, trading systems and others, who can work with clients in their Aladdin environments to provide a more customized and seamless end-to-end experience.
BlackRock is also investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth through the substantially complete migration of Aladdin from BlackRock-hosted data centers to the cloud. This is expected to bring enhanced capabilities to BlackRock and its Aladdin clients, accelerating innovation and supporting greater computing scale and flexibility for clients. Through this migration as well as BlackRock’s partnership with Snowflake, an industry leader in cloud enabled data technology, BlackRock is building Aladdin Data Cloud, a next generation solution that brings Aladdin and non-Aladdin data together, so clients can nimbly access and use data across their organization, unlocking their full potential for collaboration, creativity, and innovation.
In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in the financial technology and digital distribution companies Human Interest, Circle, Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Clarity AI. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense).
Securities Lending
Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash received as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.
Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $355 billion, down from $389 billion at year-end 2021. Lower demand for general collateral securities resulted in lower balances compared to 2021. Intrinsic lending spreads were higher, while cash reinvestment spreads remained lower as cash yields continued to compress slightly.
BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity, and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.
Risk and Quantitative Analysis
Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk and Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.
COMPETITION
BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms, financial technology providers and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.
HUMAN CAPITAL
With approximately 19,800 employees in more than 30 countries, as of December 31, 2022, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. As an asset manager, BlackRock’s long-term success depends on its people and how it manages its workforce.
Culture and Principles
BlackRock believes that maintaining a strong corporate culture is an important component of its human capital management practices and critical to the firm’s long-term success. BlackRock’s culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify its workforce and guide how it interacts with its employees, its clients, the communities in which it operates and its other stakeholders: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock; (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)
BlackRock believes a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive work environment are key factors in achieving better outcomes across all levels of its business. BlackRock has made a long-term commitment to cultivating diversity, equity and inclusion in its workforce and leadership team through its hiring, retention, promotion and development practices. As part of this long-term commitment, BlackRock has instituted a multi-year DEI strategy that it believes is actionable, measurable and designed to apply across the many countries in which the firm operates. The Company has aligned its DEI strategy with the firm’s business priorities and long-term objectives. BlackRock’s DEI strategy centers on talent and culture, responding to the needs of our clients, and policy and social impact in the communities in which we operate.
To advance its DEI strategy, BlackRock strives to:
•Expand partnerships with external organizations and develop strategies to increase the diversity of applicant pools;
•Strengthen talent acquisition and management processes in an effort to eliminate bias; and
•Implement leadership development, networking, sponsorship and coaching initiatives to engage and develop underrepresented talent.
Another focus of BlackRock’s DEI strategy is to foster an inclusive, equitable work environment in which employees feel connected to BlackRock’s culture and supported in pursuit of their professional goals. To this end, BlackRock has committed to raising employee awareness of racial equity issues and setting high behavioral expectations for employees, as well as to holding firm leaders and managers accountable for continued progress toward the firm’s goals.
BlackRock views transparency and accountability as a critical part of its DEI strategy, including as a means to inform, measure and improve its human capital management practices. To that end, since 2020, the firm has published annual SASB-aligned disclosure and EEO-1 reports, and in 2022, the firm published its inaugural Global DEI Annual Report, each of which include information regarding workforce diversity. During 2020, BlackRock also set goals for increasing the overall workplace representation of US Black and Latinx employees and growing the number of senior women globally and US Black and Latinx leaders at the Director level and above. As of January 1, 2023, of the Company’s employees who self-identified their gender status, approximately 44% of the Company's global workforce, 32% of global senior leaders (Directors or above) and 47% of global new hires, were women. Additionally, as of January 1, 2023, of the Company’s US employees who self-identified their race/ethnicity status, approximately 8% of employees, 4% of senior leaders and 12% of new hires identified as Black or African American, 8% of employees, 4% of senior leaders and 10% of new hires identified as Latinx, and 27% of employees, 20% of senior leaders and 33% of new hires identified as Asian. Further, of the Company's approximately 19,800 employees as of December 31, 2022, 47% were based in the Americas, 31% were based in EMEA and 22% were based in Asia-Pacific regions.
Board Oversight of Human Capital Management
BlackRock’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management and devotes one Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock’s culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, DEI strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee (“MDCC”) periodically reviews the progress made toward the firm’s DEI goals and other human capital management objectives. This progress is considered in compensation outcomes, including individual compensation outcomes for executive officers, that are approved by the MDCC.
Succession planning for BlackRock’s Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives is a key part of the Board’s annual review of human capital management issues. As part of this review, the Board focuses on whether BlackRock has the right people in place to execute the Company’s long-term strategic plans, and on BlackRock’s ability to identify, attract, develop, promote and retain future senior executives. An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within and increasing diversity in leadership roles.
Employee Engagement
BlackRock values continuous dialogue with its employees to better understand their experiences at the firm and assess the efficacy of its human capital management practices. The Company uses several employee engagement mechanisms, including: (1) employee opinion pulse surveys; (2) interactive events and communications; and (3) the sponsorship of employee networks. The employee opinion pulse surveys, which BlackRock conducts multiple times per year, provide the Company with actionable feedback for its teams and for the Company as a whole. Additionally, BlackRock uses ongoing lifecycle surveys to collect feedback on various areas of employee focus. BlackRock works to keep employees informed and engaged through a regular cadence of communications and events, including weekly newsletters, global and local townhalls and messages from leaders with timely business and organizational updates and culture-building opportunities. BlackRock’s employee networks also provide additional forums and opportunities for employees with a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to connect with one another and enhance the firm’s culture. Open to all, the networks are designed by employees, for employees, are sponsored by senior leaders and strengthen the One BlackRock community.
Compensation, Wellness and Benefits
BlackRock is committed to responsible business practices and believes that investing in the physical, emotional, mental and financial well-being of its employees is a critical component of the firm’s human capital management strategy. To that end, the Company designs its compensation and benefits practices to: (1) attract, retain and motivate talented employees; (2) align employee incentives and risk-taking with that of the firm and the interests of its clients; and (3) support employees across many aspects of their lives. The Company has a strong pay-for-performance culture and an annual compensation process that takes into consideration firmwide results, individual business results and employee performance, as well as market benchmarks. BlackRock also offers a wide range of benefits that it regularly reviews in accordance with leading best practices and the local requirements of its offices, including, where applicable, retirement savings plans, a Flexible Time Off (“FTO”) policy and flexible working arrangements, and parental leave and family support benefits, including fertility benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, and backup elder and childcare benefits. The Company provides comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, counseling services, an employee assistance program and access to telemedicine services, where available.
BlackRock prioritizes protecting the rights of its workforce and the equitable treatment of its employees. The Company has implemented policies related to harassment prevention and compliance with equal employment opportunity and overtime regulations. BlackRock is also committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for its workforce. To do this, it designs global programs, including environmental and occupational health and safety programs, to meet or exceed local requirements. Moreover, BlackRock encourages all of its employees to raise issues of concern and assures employees that they may do so without fear of retaliation.
As the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy, BlackRock continues to communicate about the telemedicine and digital health resources it has available, including mental, emotional and physical health offerings. For example, the Company offers several benefits to support mental health, including a Mental Health Ambassador program that is comprised of global volunteers across office locations who act as allies for firmwide mental health awareness and direct interested colleagues to mental health resources.
Training, Innovation and Development
BlackRock is committed to innovation, learning and reinvention in all areas of its business and believes that developing the capabilities of its employees is integral to delivering long-term value. To that end, the Company’s human capital management practices are designed to provide opportunities for employees to learn, innovate and enhance their skillsets at every stage of their career. One example is the BlackRock Academies, the firm’s online suite of interactive resources and courses, which enable employees to build skills in specific facets of BlackRock’s business and purpose. The Company believes these opportunities play an important role in engaging BlackRock’s employees.
In addition, BlackRock believes that a critical driver of its future success is its ability to grow strong leaders and people managers. The Company invests in leadership development programs designed to foster career growth. For leadership development, select employees are invited to participate in programs that include executive coaching, in-person and virtual learning and senior management sponsorship. Further, BlackRock provides training and makes coaching available to people managers to assist in building foundational skills.
REGULATION
Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.
BlackRock’s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, securities, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.
GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM
Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) and Bank for International Settlements, may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Most recently, such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities
of non-bank financial institutions, money market funds (“MMFs”), open-ended funds (“OEFs”), central counterparty margin practices and enhanced ESG disclosures.
Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers
Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened since the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by the recent Liquidity Driven Investment events in the UK. Such events have prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). In November 2022, the SEC proposed, among other things, amendments to the rules governing OEF liquidity risk management and swing pricing. The European Union (“EU”) has also proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs, enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and allow such regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require BlackRock to make changes to structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.
Global MMF Reforms
Following the market events of March 2020, US, EU and UK authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of MMFs in market downturns. The ongoing review of the EU Money Market Fund Regulation could result in significant changes to the rules around liquidity and how some MMFs price shares. The UK may materially depart from the EU approach as the UK develops its own legal and regulatory framework for MMFs domiciled or marketed in the UK. In the US, the SEC proposed changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 governing MMFs, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of such funds, and changes in pricing under certain circumstances. Such regulatory reforms, if adopted, could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock’s MMF products.
ESG and Sustainability
ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. Globally, the International Sustainability Standards Board and the development of its disclosure standards may inform national regulators’ approaches on these topics. In the US, the SEC has proposed a series of rules that would require, among other things: (1) corporate issuers to make substantial climate-related disclosures in their periodic reports, including with respect to governance, risk management, business strategy, financial statement metrics and greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and (2) enhanced ESG disclosures by investment companies and investment advisers in fund and adviser filings, including disclosures regarding ESG strategies and how ESG factors are considered, and GHG emissions disclosure by certain environmentally focused funds. The SEC also announced plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased its scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers’ and funds’ ESG strategies, policies and procedures. In addition, the US Department of Labor (the “DOL”) recently issued final rules clarifying that Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) plan fiduciaries can, but are not required to, consider the economic effects of ESG factors for purposes of investing ERISA plan assets and exercising voting rights with respect to plan investments. Some US states and/or state officials have adopted or proposed legislation or otherwise have taken official positions restricting or prohibiting state government entities from doing certain business with entities identified by the state as “boycotting” or “discriminating” against particular industries or considering ESG factors in their investment processes and proxy voting. Other states and localities may adopt similar legislation or other ESG-related laws and positions.
The EU has enacted numerous regulations on ESG and sustainability, including to require sustainability-related disclosure by financial market participants; require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; and make the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences. Further rules are expected to come into force in 2023 and beyond. In addition, requirements for asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities took effect in 2022, with a further phase expected in 2023, and new proposed regulation to enhance sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers is expected to take effect in 2024. BlackRock’s EU asset management companies and investment firms will be required to publish granular disclosures relating to the ESG characteristics of their funds and portfolios starting in 2023. The EU also proposed a draft directive in 2022 that would apply new supply chain due diligence obligations pertaining to sustainability to a wide group of global companies. Furthermore, the EU released a consultation on ESG and sustainability factors in credit ratings. The EU and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) are developing guidelines for the use of ESG or sustainability related terms in fund names, focused on specifying a minimum threshold of assets meeting ESG or sustainable criteria for such funds.
Within the UK, the government has mandated climate-related risk reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) framework at UK firm and product level with first disclosures due in 2023. In addition, the FCA has proposed UK-specific sustainability regulations, including a sustainable product classification system for funds, which are expected to come into force on a staggered basis from 2023 through 2025.
In Asia, policymakers in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan issued or proposed sustainability-related regulations. For instance, requirements for asset managers to integrate climate risk considerations in investment and risk management processes, together with relevant disclosure obligations, became effective in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2022. ESG fund naming and related disclosure rules became effective in Hong Kong in 2022 and in Singapore in January 2023. Further, Singapore and Japan announced enhanced sustainability reporting requirements for corporate issuers. In 2022, Japan finalized its voluntary code of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers. Meanwhile, Australia’s securities regulator issued information on “greenwashing"", and the Australian government is seeking input on the design and implementation of a climate-related financial disclosure regime.
Taxation
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on net stock repurchases. BlackRock does not expect the IRA to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In addition, legislation at both the US federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission (“EC”) has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of
EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15%. In December 2022, EU member states agreed to adopt the OECD’s minimum tax rules, which are expected to begin going into effect in 2024. Several other countries, including the UK, are also considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD’s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which we do business could change, and any such changes could increase our tax liabilities.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
LIBOR Transition
The global transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) continues to progress. Tenors of non-USD LIBOR ceased to be published at the end of 2021 while publication of most USD LIBOR settings is expected to continue through June 2023. In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) was signed into law, establishing a framework for the replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark in US law contracts that reference certain tenors of USD LIBOR and do not provide for a clearly defined and practicable benchmark replacement rate following the cessation of publication. In July 2022, the Federal Reserve Board solicited public comment on proposed LIBOR transition regulations implementing the LIBOR Act. Other global regulatory authorities such as the FCA have issued consultations regarding the wind-down of LIBOR. If such proposals are not finalized, parties to unremediated contracts, and the markets more generally, face the potential for uncertainty, disputes, litigation and market disruption.
Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds
As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of ETFs in the markets, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company’s business.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements.
In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to central clearing and trading venue execution requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (""Dodd-Frank""), with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. Further, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, are subject to requirements in the US, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks.
US REGULATORY REFORM
Antitrust Rules and Guidance
In 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) proposed certain changes to rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (1) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (2) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposed aggregation requirement could, absent applicable exemptions, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely creating significant tracking error and cash drag for index funds and opportunity costs for actively managed funds, require implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where filing a pre-merger notification is not practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock’s aggregate position in certain issuers if BlackRock is unable to satisfy the revised regulatory requirements. In 2021, the FTC voted to withdraw its approval of the Vertical Merger Guidelines, previously issued jointly with the DOJ. In 2022 the FTC and DOJ jointly released a request for public comment on modernizing the agencies’ approach to the merger guidelines, including whether to dispense with the guidelines’ traditional distinction between the treatment of horizontal and vertical mergers. Such changes could have an effect on the ability of the Company to expand its services through strategic investments or acquisitions.
SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers
The SEC has engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. For example, in October 2022, the SEC adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports and proposed amendments expanding the scope of the application of the rule governing fund names, including to, among other things, fund names that include ESG or similar terms.
Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) Review
The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the US under Dodd-Frank. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from an entity-specific approach and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management, which was re-affirmed in December 2019 guidance. However, recent public reports and statements by FSOC members have suggested a willingness to support a repeal or amendment to certain parts of the 2019 guidance to provide the FSOC more flexibility to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
The SEC, Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, any such limitations or restrictions could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.
In October 2020, the SEC adopted regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (“RICs”), including mutual funds (other than MMFs), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. RICs were required to implement and comply with this rule beginning in 2022. The rule, among other things, imposes limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a RIC can enter into, eliminates the asset segregation compliance framework and introduces new compliance requirements for funds, including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs. The rule may impact certain RICs’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy.
In December 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (“SBS”) transactions to require public reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts.
SEC Proposed Rules on Private Fund Advisers
During 2022, the SEC proposed new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These include a series of proposed amendments to Form PF for registered investment advisers that: (1) add new required disclosures, (2) require advisers to file reports within one business day for certain significant events, (3) lower the threshold for large private equity adviser reporting, (4) increase reporting obligations on large liquidity fund advisers, and (5) enhance reporting on basic information about advisers and the funds they advise. The SEC proposed additional rules that would, among other things, require registered private fund advisers to: (1) provide quarterly reports to investors of fund performance, fees and expenses, (2) obtain an annual audit for each fund and (3) distribute to investors a fairness opinion and summary of certain material business relationships with the opinion provider in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction. The proposed rules would also prohibit private fund advisers from engaging in certain activities and practices deemed to be contrary to the public interest and investor protection, providing certain types of preferential terms for selected investors and providing any other forms of preferential treatment unless disclosed. These rules and amendments, if adopted as proposed, could significantly increase BlackRock’s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock’s alternatives products.
SEC Rule 15c2-11
SEC Rule 15c2-11 governs the submission of quotes into quotation systems by broker-dealers and has historically been applied to the over-the-counter (“OTC”) equity markets. However, the SEC has stated that it intends to apply the rule to fixed income securities. While SEC staff issued additional no-action relief in November 2022 delaying implementation of the rule to segments of the fixed income markets until 2025, full implementation may disrupt primary and secondary market liquidity.
Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS
In January 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of “exchange” and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules may impact certain functionality and tools offered by Aladdin, which may increase compliance costs for BlackRock.
Proposed US Treasury Clearing Mandate
In September 2022, the SEC proposed rules that would mandate central clearing of certain US Treasury transactions. If enacted as proposed, the rules would require many market participants, including a large number of BlackRock funds and accounts, to clear cash Treasury securities transactions and Treasury repurchase transactions through a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which could result in increased transaction costs for our clients.
INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORM
EU Market Access and Outsourcing
The EU legislature continues to consider proposals amending both the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) and Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities fund frameworks. The proposed changes remain broadly consistent with the current regulatory framework but with increased notification requirements to national regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), enhanced liquidity management requirements and new requirements for loan originating funds. There is also a proposal to require notification for instances of significant delegation of portfolio management or risk management functions to entities located outside the EU. ESMA would then be required to present market analysis and supervisory peer review every two years to the European
Parliament (“EP”). These proposals and any further regulatory actions could impact delegated activities, increase compliance costs and impact products and services offered to EU clients.
Revised Capital Requirements for Investment Firms
In June 2021, the Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for investment firms in scope of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive for investment firms proposed by the EC came into effect, resulting in changes to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in the EU, changes to the method of calculating such capital and liquidity, and revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK has also adopted comparable rules under the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (“IFPR”), which have applied to UK-based investment firms from January 2022. Changes to the supervisory approach to assessing the risk of harm posed by BlackRock’s operations or asset management activities more broadly could increase the amount of regulatory capital and liquidity required to be held in the future, and the new rules impose other prudential requirements.
Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms
The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, entered into force in January 2023, with the requirements expected to become applicable in January 2025. DORA will, among other things: (1) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. In parallel with DORA, the UK has signaled its intention to provide His Majesty's Treasury powers to designate certain third parties to the financial sector as “critical” and subject them to oversight by UK regulators. This regime is expected to build on existing UK requirements regarding firms’ operational resilience and use of technology.
EU Central Securities Depository Regulation
Aspects of the settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation came into effect in February 2022. These include rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions. However, the mandatory buy-in regime is delayed to June 2025. Implementation of the regime required new operational mechanisms to facilitate compliance, which may increase required resources and cost.
UK Review of Retained EU Law
Under the Financial Services and Markets Bill (the “FSM Bill”) introduced in July 2022, retained EU law relating to financial services and markets will be revoked and UK financial regulators will be delegated substantial rulemaking powers to amend and restate such retained laws. Several UK regimes are currently subject to regulatory changes as the UK considers changes to retained EU rules following the UK’s exit from the EU, including the Wholesale Markets Review of MiFID II (as defined below) and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (“MiFIR”) frameworks, consumer disclosures, and the regime for non-UK-based funds that are recognized for sale into the UK, which is also currently under government review.
UK Overseas Fund Regime
The Overseas Fund Regime (“OFR”), the simplified regime through which non-UK funds can register with the FCA to be marketed to UK retail investors, was enacted in February 2022 and is expected to be implemented over the next two years. The OFR will require consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled to be found equivalent to the UK’s regime in order to market such funds in the UK.
UK Conduct Regime
The FCA continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the implementation of the Consumer Duty by all asset management firms, including BlackRock’s UK subsidiaries. The Consumer Duty rules require firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers in their manufacture and distribution of products and services, in respect of price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. The rules are expected to come into force in July 2023. Any failure to meet the FCA’s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk.
Edinburgh Reforms
In December 2022, the UK announced wide-ranging reforms to financial services regulation which build on the FSM Bill, marking further potential divergence from EU regimes. Potential impacts to the asset management sector include: (1) repeal and replacement of the packaged retail and insurance based investment products (""PRIIPs"") Regulation; (2) review of the UK’s green finance strategy, including potential regulation of ESG data providers; (3) review of governance through the Senior Managers and Certification Regime; (4) repeal of EU legislation on the European Long-Term Investment Fund; (5) market infrastructure reforms; (6) reassessment of the boundary between investment advice and financial guidance; and (7) independent review of the UK investment research landscape.
Reform of Investment Markets
BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company’s provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The Regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms were substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. Forthcoming proposals to review the operation of MiFID II and to develop a new EU Retail Investment Strategy may affect the European market structure and impact BlackRock’s ability to operate in European markets. The broad nature of MiFID II means future reforms could also affect product development, client servicing and distribution models. Similar reforms have been implemented in Switzerland and Australia.
Regulatory Environment in China
The Company’s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company’s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on the transfer of the Company’s Chinese onshore data to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock’s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock’s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement
complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance.
EXISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DOL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the FTC, the Department of Justice, the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies.
Certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as certain BlackRock subsidiaries, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through attorneys general, insurance commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities.
The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as certain BlackRock subsidiaries and affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, Dodd-Frank requires one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”). BTC's registration as a municipal advisor subjects BTC to additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.
BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, real estate funds, collective trust funds, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rulemaking or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA.
BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of Dodd-Frank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. In addition, two of BlackRock’s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also a member of the MSRB and is subject to MSRB rules.
BlackRock’s business activity in California that involves the processing of personal information is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which provide for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA and CPRA impose obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. In addition, several other US states have proposed or adopted similar privacy laws. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA, CPRA or similar state privacy laws may result in fines, heightened regulatory scrutiny, litigation and/or reputational harm.
US Banking Regulation
One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC’s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders.
EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.
Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.
Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.
European Regulation
The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branch of one of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital and liquidity resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business requirements, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.
In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established, including the branches of the Netherlands entity which operate across the EU.
BlackRock’s EU subsidiaries and branches must comply with the EU regulatory regime set out in MiFID II. BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries must comply with the UK version of MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities in the UK. MiFID II, and the UK equivalent of MiFID II, set out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. The legislation also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock UK subsidiaries must also comply with the UK regulation which implements the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for certain investment firms arising out of the IFPR. These include requirements to ensure capital adequacy, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, as implemented in the relevant EU Member States and in the UK, which impose obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of retail and alternative investment funds respectively that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will affect certain of BlackRock’s European operations. Compliance with the UCITS Directives and the AIFMD may subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements. BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (""EMIR"") (or the UK version of EMIR transposed into UK law in accordance with The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in the case of BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (1) the central clearing of certain OTC derivatives; (2) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties); and (3) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an ESMA registered or recognized derivatives trade repository (or a UK authorized trade repository in the case of the UK version of EMIR).
The EU has seen an increase in Common Supervisory Actions by ESMA to coordinate supervisory action by national EU regulators, most notably in areas such as product governance, liquidity management and fund costs and charges. BlackRock’s EU operations may be affected to the extent this initiative results in formal legislation or action.
EU Member States, the UK and many other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of personal data security breaches if certain thresholds are met. For example, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in 2018, and the UK transposed the GDPR into national law (“UK GDPR”), which became effective in 2021. In July 2020, the EU-US Privacy Shield was invalidated as a valid personal data transfer mechanism and in June 2021, the EC published a new set of standard contractual clauses, which only apply to the transfer of personal data outside of the EU to a country not approved by the EU as providing an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data. The EU's adequacy decision with respect to the UK, which allows the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, will be regularly reviewed and may be revoked if the UK diverges from its current adequate data protection laws. The UK has developed its own international data transfer agreement, which was implemented in March 2022. GDPR and UK GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock’s collection, processing, retention and transfer of personal data and reporting of personal data security breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.
BlackRock also maintains two offices in the Middle East, one in Dubai, which is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority, and one in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is regulated by the Saudi Capital Markets Authority. Both offices are authorized to provide certain investment services and support BlackRock’s provision of investment products and services in their countries of domicile. Other countries across the Middle Eastern region are serviced on a cross-border basis.
Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region
In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (“FIEA”) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEA. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act.
In Australia, BlackRock’s operating entity is principally regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”), which includes holding an Australian financial services license and operating registered managed investment schemes. ASIC is Australia’s integrated corporate, markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator.
The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC.
BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector.
BlackRock’s Fund Management Company in China (“BlackRock FMC”) is regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and is subject to the Securities Investment Fund Law and Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Mutual Fund Managers for the overall oversight from incorporation to the corporate governance and operations of fund managers and funds. BlackRock FMC is also subject to the China Securities Law and various other financial laws and regulations. BlackRock CCB Wealth Management Limited, which is BlackRock’s wealth management joint venture company with CCB Wealth Management Co., Ltd. and Fullerton Management Pte Ltd. in China, is regulated by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CBIRC”). CBIRC have enacted Bank Wealth Management Supervision and Management Measures and Management Measures of Bank Wealth Management Subsidiaries since 2018 to regulate the setup, conduct of business and risk management of bank wealth management companies.
In Singapore, a BlackRock subsidiary is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) and its business activities are subject to the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (“SFA”). The SFA governs the regulation of activities and institutions in the securities and derivatives industry, including leveraged foreign exchange trading of financial benchmarks and of clearing facilities. The MAS is Singapore’s central bank and integrated financial regulator, which regulates the financial services sector in Singapore and conducts integrated supervision of financial services and financial stability surveillance. This BlackRock subsidiary and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFA are required to be licensed with the MAS, and are subject to the SFA and the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the MAS.
Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.

As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, reputational, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.
MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS
Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of its clients, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, could cause:
•the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;
•client redemptions from BlackRock’s products;
•client rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;
•an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.
These risks may also be heightened by market volatility, illiquid market conditions or other market disruptions. The occurrence of any of the above events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock’s AUM and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s net income and operating cash flows.
In past years, there were prolonged periods of historically low interest rates, interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates. Recently, global markets have experienced substantial volatility, with significant downturns in both bond and equity markets. In addition, central banks worldwide have raised interest rates in an effort to moderate rising inflation. BlackRock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Similarly, due to the global nature of BlackRock’s operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the United States (""US"") dollar. BlackRock’s exposure to foreign exchange rates relative to the US dollar and interest rates may cause BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s base fees, net income and operating cash flows.
In addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees.
BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund’s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on similar terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance.
Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such BlackRock products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The investment management industry is highly competitive, and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, liquidity, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, over the past several years, there has been significant consolidation in the asset management and financial services industries as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multi-asset investment capabilities and technological expertise, including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs. This consolidation, together with the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with the products, services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock’s competitive success. Aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand toward standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform offerings or flexibility, or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, to the extent that Aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than BlackRock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, BlackRock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in Aladdin.
BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk.
BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of increasingly customizable products, requires continued innovative effort on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services, constraints on BlackRock’s ability to manage growth within client mandates, compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements and intellectual property-related lawsuits or claims. A growing number of BlackRock’s new products and services also depend on data provided by third parties as analytical inputs and are subject to additional risks, including with respect to data quality, cost, availability and provider relationships. Data sets for certain developing analytics, such as those in the sustainability space, continue to evolve and difficulties approximating gaps in the data, sourcing data from reliable sources, or validating the data could adversely impact the accuracy and effectiveness of such tools. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timeline they require. Any failure to successfully develop new products and services, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm BlackRock’s reputation and expose the Company to additional costs, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns as well as certain of BlackRock’s minority investments could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.
At December 31, 2022, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $3.3 billion in its investments (see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as certain minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline.
BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.
BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2022 and subject to this type of indemnification was approximately $253 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling approximately $268 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2022. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s decision on whether to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to seed, warehouse or otherwise support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Any decision by BlackRock on whether to support products may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. BlackRock’s ability to seed, warehouse or otherwise support certain products may be restricted by regulation or by the Company’s failure to have or make available sufficient capital or liquidity. Moreover, inherent constraints arising from the business models of certain asset managers, including BlackRock, may during periods of market volatility result in BlackRock having fewer options for accessing liquidity than asset managers with alternate business models, which may adversely impact its ability to support certain products. Any decision by BlackRock to support particular products, or the inability to provide such support, may result in losses, which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock’s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, terrorist activity or acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. For instance, the war between Russia and Ukraine has and may continue to result in geopolitical instability and adversely affect the global economy, supply chains and specific markets. Strategic competition between the US and China and resulting tensions have also contributed to uncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory landscapes. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock’s control, including natural disasters, climate-related events, pandemics or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by
governmental actions that may increase international tension. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company’s products, operations, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackRock currently operates or is seeking to expand its presence.
Climate-related risks could adversely affect BlackRock’s business, products, operations and clients, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s business and those of its clients could be impacted by climate-related risks. Climate-related risks may impact BlackRock through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Climate-related physical risks arise from the direct impacts of a changing climate in the short- and long-term. Such risks may include the risks of extreme weather events and changes in temperature, which may damage infrastructure and facilities, including BlackRock’s physical assets, as well as disrupt connectivity or supply chains. Climate-related transition risks arise from exposure to the transition to a lower-carbon economy through policy, regulatory, technology and market changes. For instance, new or divergent climate regulations or guidance, as well as differing perspectives of stakeholders regarding climate impacts, have affected and may continue to affect BlackRock’s business activities and reputation, increase scrutiny and complicate compliance requirements, which could increase the Company’s costs.
Climate-related physical and transition risks could also impact BlackRock’s business both directly and indirectly through adverse impacts to its clients’ investments, including as a result of declines in asset values, changes in client preferences, increased regulatory and compliance costs and significant business disruptions. Any of these risks may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE
Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:
•client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors;
•client shifts to products that charge lower fees;
•the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;
•reduced, minimal or no performance fees;
•an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital.
Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.
A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $514 million, or 3%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company’s performance fee generating assets. In particular, the Company expects that as it manages more illiquid products, its performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products.
Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.
BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors or limitations in the underlying models, model inputs or assumptions, including those from third-party sources, as well as any failure of BlackRock’s governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models, model inputs or assumptions or the failure to timely update such models, model inputs or assumptions, could have adverse effects on BlackRock’s business and reputation. These risks may be heightened by the rapid growth and complexity of new models, evolving data sets and standards and market volatility.
RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect BlackRock’s business, operations and financial condition which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause significant harm to the US and global economies. It has also had and may continue to have an ongoing adverse impact on BlackRock’s business, including its operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things, the negative impact of the pandemic on financial markets, BlackRock’s clients, key vendors (such as pricing providers), market participants and other third parties with whom it does business, and workforce disruption due to continued periods away from physical office locations in certain regions and illness and health concerns, any of which may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The extent to which COVID-19, and the related impact on the global economy, may continue to affect BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the emergence and spread of new variants of the COVID-19 virus and/or other concurrent or overlapping pandemics and health crises, the availability, adoption and efficacy of future treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BlackRock’s products, clients, vendors and employees, any of which may exacerbate the other risks described herein.
TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS
A failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock’s operations, systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the Company’s reputation and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations is concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London, Budapest, Atlanta and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic, health crisis or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt BlackRock’s operations in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in business disruption or impede the Company's growth. In addition, these risks may be heightened during BlackRock’s move to its new headquarters in New York, which is expected to be completed in 2023.
Despite BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations or contractual obligations leading to reputational harm, legal liability, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.
A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them, including data provided by third parties that is significant to portions of BlackRock's business and products. An externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack including a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, or denial-of-service or ransomware attack, or an internally caused incident or disruption, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, developments in BlackRock’s use of process automation, as well as the use of remote access by employees and mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock’s control. BlackRock’s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information or third-party data. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.
The financial services industry has been the subject of cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors and terrorist organizations. BlackRock has been and continues to be the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and continues to monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and cause financial losses. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures proves effective. In addition, a successful cyber-attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and it may take a considerable amount of time for an investigation to be completed and the severity and potential impact to be known. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock’s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock’s systems.
In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock or any such third party may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock or such third parties may not have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.
Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, BlackRock’s cybersecurity insurance may not cover all losses and damages from such events and BlackRock’s ability to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future may be limited.
Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
BlackRock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. In so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers, including for cloud hosting and technologies supporting cloud-based operations. For example, Aladdin’s data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to Aladdin’s growth. In addition, the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin’s analytical calculations. Although BlackRock has implemented internal controls and procedures and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the Aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. Any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with Aladdin’s size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise Aladdin’s resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients.
Continuing enhancements to Aladdin’s capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.
The operation of BlackRock’s Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, configuration change management, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. These updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose BlackRock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, increased costs, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
In addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions. In addition, there has been increased regulatory scrutiny globally on technology and information providers, which may impact Aladdin.
Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.
BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. In addition, while BlackRock, Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements, certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards, which require them to maintain certain levels of capital and liquidity. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.
Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses.
BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from any losses related to the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks.
Inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.
BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, deliver whole-portfolio solutions, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures, entering into strategic joint ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses, analytics, models and other intellectual property. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases, the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions, and such transactions may be the subject of unanticipated liabilities arising from commercial disputes, information security vulnerabilities or breaches and intellectual property or other legal claims. The success of BlackRock’s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock’s inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products, business lines or early stage investments or are delivered via technology and systems that differ from those employed by BlackRock. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock’s control, as well as risks related to the jurisdictions or markets in which such investees or joint ventures operate. For example, BlackRock has a minority investment in Circle Internet Financial (“Circle”), which is associated with crypto asset markets that recently experienced substantial volatility and high-profile enterprise failures and bankruptcies. The crypto asset markets are subject to significant regulatory uncertainty, which could also negatively impact BlackRock’s investment in Circle. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, governance or oversight rights, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could result in losses or impairments related to such transactions and have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry.
BlackRock's alternatives products include investments in early-stage companies, private equity portfolio companies and real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, which may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.
BlackRock’s alternatives products include investments in early-stage companies, private equity portfolio companies and real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, that may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such investments and portfolio companies. These may include:
•risks related to the potential illiquidity, valuation and disposition of such investments;
•risks related to emerging and less established companies that have, among other things, short operating histories, new technologies and products, nascent control functions, quickly evolving markets and limited financial resources;
•construction risks, including as a result of force majeure, labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;
•accidents, pandemics, health crises or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control;
•climate-related risks, including greater frequency or intensity of adverse weather and natural disasters;
•personal injury or property damage;
•failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;
•exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;
•environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;
•changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;
•risks related to the availability, cost, coverage and other limitations on insurance;
•the financial resources of tenants; and
•contingent liabilities on disposition of investments.
The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanctions or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock’s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management’s attention away from BlackRock’s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks.
As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Operating outside the US may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. Similarly, certain jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates may not have comparable levels of protection for corporate assets, such as intellectual property, and client information and records, as the US. As a result, there may also be heightened information security or privacy risks in those jurisdictions. Any theft of data, technology or intellectual property may negatively impact BlackRock’s business operations and reputation. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL
The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Many of BlackRock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock’s operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, or errors in judgment. Such risks may be exacerbated in times of increased market volatility, high trading volumes or workforce turnover. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks. Notwithstanding these measures, BlackRock cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks and BlackRock employees have in the past engaged in improper conduct. In addition, BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may in the future deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. This risk may be heightened as BlackRock expands into new markets and increases the breadth of its business offerings and remote and alternative work models, all of which introduce additional complexity to its risk management program. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, cause adverse publicity, and result in litigation, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure to recruit, train and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is highly competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified and diverse employees include the Company’s reputation and workplace culture, the immigration and public health policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, its approach to remote and alternative work models, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.
In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to certain of its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, decreases in BlackRock’s share price could impair the retention value of such deferred compensation. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.
RISKS RELATED TO KEY THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS
The impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that BlackRock manages, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose BlackRock’s clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. Counterparties may also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk management systems or expose BlackRock and/or its clients to losses on account of employee malfeasance, negligence or human error. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackRock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple BlackRock clients. Any such operational issue, impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts that BlackRock manages for its clients, which may lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure of key third-party providers to BlackRock to fulfill their obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock depends on a number of key third-party providers for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market and ESG data, market indices, insurance, technology, cloud hosting and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. Further, BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients’ investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock’s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. While BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. In addition, BlackRock’s operations and processes rely on commercially available data provided by third parties as well as providers of services, including technology services, and operating errors, process failures or failures to comply with data usage requirements with respect to these service providers may adversely impact BlackRock. Data providers commonly disclaim the accuracy and completeness of data and BlackRock does not have the ability to validate or verify the accuracy and completeness of commercially sourced datasets. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock’s arrangement with a vendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.
BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one third-party provider to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key third-party provider to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management or other agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational, legal and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company’s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock.
Key technology partnerships may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory oversight, as well as migration, execution, technology and operational risks.
In April 2020, BlackRock announced a strategic partnership to host Aladdin infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure cloud and commenced a multi-year plan to migrate the Aladdin environments for BlackRock and its external Aladdin clients to the cloud. In addition, BlackRock has also migrated certain systems that support its corporate functions to cloud-based platforms. The benefits of cloud-based platforms are significant and BlackRock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its migration strategies; however these partnerships also introduce new risks,
including: (1) risks associated with relying on third-parties for aspects of infrastructure reliability and stability; (2) software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology; (3) operational and execution risks, including those related to migration; and (4) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations, which risks may be further exacerbated as BlackRock and the Aladdin platform continue to grow. Any failure by BlackRock to manage these risks, and/or risks associated with future potential technology partnerships, may result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.
BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value (“NAV”). The NAV of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF’s holdings. The trading price of the ETF’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. The creation/redemption feature and arbitrage mechanism of an ETF are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the NAV. Notwithstanding these features, exchange prices have in the past deviated measurably from the NAV of certain ETFs and may under certain circumstances do so in the future. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, and the inability or unwillingness of market makers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively. These risks may be heightened as a result of significant market volatility, the growth of the ETF industry combined with increased market activity, as well as the complexity associated with certain products. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate meaningfully from an ETF’s NAV, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS
BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world, which increases its cost of doing business.
BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex.
In addition, many of BlackRock’s legal entities are subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives, the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017, the UK Bribery Act, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations and the EU and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which BlackRock operates, such as His Majesty’s Treasury’s (“HMT”) Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation.
BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the GDPR and UK GDPR, which expand data protection rules for individuals within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and UK, respectively, and for personal data exported outside the EEA and UK.
BlackRock is additionally subject to scrutiny from various government agencies that focus on antitrust and competition laws and regulations within the US and internationally, including in connection with merger control proceedings and proposed investments. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company’s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted.
BlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BTC’s bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see Item 1, Business - Regulation.
New regulations informed by global standard setters and/or developed by various national authorities may expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) and Bank for International Settlements, may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Most recently, such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities of non-bank financial institutions, money market funds (“MMFs”), open-ended funds (“OEFs”), central counterparty margin practices and enhanced ESG disclosures. BlackRock is, and may become, subject to increasing regulation in these areas, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, including:
•Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers: Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened since the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by the recent Liquidity Driven Investment events in the UK. Such events have prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). In November 2022, the SEC proposed, among other things, amendments to the rules governing OEF liquidity risk management and swing pricing. The EU has also proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs, enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and allow such regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require BlackRock to make changes to
structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.
•Global MMF Reforms: Following the market events of March 2020, US, EU and UK authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of MMFs in market downturns. The ongoing review of the EU Money Market Fund Regulation could result in significant changes to the rules around liquidity and how some MMFs price shares. The UK may materially depart from the EU approach as the UK develops its own legal and regulatory framework for MMFs domiciled or marketed in the UK. In the US, the SEC proposed changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 governing MMFs, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of such funds, and changes in pricing under certain circumstances. Such regulatory reforms, if adopted, could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock’s MMF products.
•ESG and Sustainability: ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. Globally, the International Sustainability Standards Board and the development of its disclosure standards may inform national regulators’ approaches on these topics. In the US, the SEC has proposed a series of rules that would require, among other things: (1) corporate issuers to make substantial climate-related disclosures in their periodic reports, including with respect to governance, risk management, business strategy, financial statement metrics and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and (2) enhanced ESG disclosures by investment companies and investment advisers in fund and adviser filings, including disclosures regarding ESG strategies and how ESG factors are considered, and GHG emissions disclosure by certain environmentally focused funds. The SEC also announced plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased its scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers’ and funds’ ESG strategies, policies and procedures. In addition, the US Department of Labor recently issued final rules clarifying that Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) plan fiduciaries can, but are not required to, consider the economic effects of ESG factors for purposes of investing ERISA plan assets and exercising voting rights with respect to plan investments. Some US states and/or state officials have adopted or proposed legislation or otherwise have taken official positions restricting or prohibiting state government entities from doing certain business with entities identified by the state as “boycotting” or “discriminating” against particular industries or considering ESG factors in their investment processes and proxy voting. Other states and localities may adopt similar legislation or other ESG-related laws and positions.
The EU has enacted numerous regulations on ESG and sustainability, including to require sustainability-related disclosure by financial market participants; require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; and make the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences. Further rules are expected to come into force in 2023 and beyond. In addition, requirements for asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities took effect in 2022, with a further phase expected in 2023, and new proposed regulation to enhance sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers is expected to take effect in 2024. BlackRock’s EU asset management companies and investment firms will be required to publish granular disclosures relating to the ESG characteristics of their funds and portfolios starting in 2023. The EU also proposed a draft directive in 2022 that would apply new supply chain due diligence obligations pertaining to sustainability to a wide group of global companies. Furthermore, the EU released a consultation on ESG and sustainability factors in credit ratings. The EU and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) are developing guidelines for the use of ESG or sustainability related terms in fund names, focused on specifying a minimum threshold of assets meeting ESG or sustainable criteria for such funds.
Within the UK, the government has mandated climate-related risk reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) framework at UK firm and product level with first disclosures due in 2023. In addition, the FCA has proposed UK-specific sustainability regulations, including a sustainable product classification system for funds, which are expected to come into force on a staggered basis from 2023 through 2025.
In Asia, policymakers in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan issued or proposed sustainability-related regulations. For instance, requirements for asset managers to integrate climate risk considerations in investment and risk management processes, together with relevant disclosure obligations, became effective in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2022. ESG fund naming and related disclosure rules became effective in Hong Kong in 2022 and in Singapore in January 2023. Further, Singapore and Japan announced enhanced sustainability reporting requirements for corporate issuers. In 2022, Japan finalized its voluntary code of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers. Meanwhile, Australia’s securities regulator issued information on “greenwashing”, and the Australian government is seeking input on the design and implementation of a climate-related financial disclosure regime.
As jurisdictions continue to develop legal frameworks on ESG and sustainability regulations, BlackRock faces increased fragmentation risk related to local implementation, resulting in complex and potentially conflicting compliance obligations and legal and regulatory uncertainty.
•LIBOR Transition: The global transition away from LIBOR continues to progress. Tenors of non-USD LIBOR ceased to be published at the end of 2021 while publication of most USD LIBOR settings is expected to continue through June 2023. In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) was signed into law, establishing a framework for the replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark in US law contracts that reference certain tenors of USD LIBOR and do not provide for a clearly defined and practicable benchmark replacement rate following the cessation of publication. In July 2022, the Federal Reserve Board solicited public comment on proposed LIBOR transition regulations implementing the LIBOR Act. Other global regulatory authorities such as the FCA have issued consultations regarding the wind-down of LIBOR. If such proposals are not finalized, parties to unremediated contracts, and the markets more generally, face the potential for uncertainty, disputes, litigation and market disruption.
Global regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
Regulatory reforms in the US expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
In recent years, a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the US, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. These risks have been heightened as the pace of regulatory rulemaking has intensified. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the US, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:
•Antitrust Rules and Guidance: In 2020, the FTC proposed certain changes to rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (1) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (2) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposed aggregation requirement could, absent applicable exemptions, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely creating significant tracking error and cash drag for index funds and opportunity costs for actively managed funds, require implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where filing a pre-merger notification is not practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock’s aggregate position in certain issuers if BlackRock is unable to satisfy the revised regulatory requirements. In 2021, the FTC voted to withdraw its approval of the Vertical Merger Guidelines, previously issued jointly with the DOJ. In 2022 the FTC and DOJ jointly released a request for public comment on modernizing the agencies’ approach to the merger guidelines, including whether to dispense with the guidelines’ traditional distinction between the treatment of horizontal and vertical mergers. Such changes could have an effect on the ability of the Company to expand its services through strategic investments or acquisitions.
•SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC has engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. For example, in October 2022, the SEC adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports and proposed amendments expanding the scope of the application of the rule governing fund names, including to, among other things, fund names that include ESG or similar terms.
•Designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”): The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the US under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from an entity-specific approach and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management, which was re-affirmed in December 2019 guidance. However, recent public reports and statements by FSOC members have suggested a willingness to support a repeal or amendment to certain parts of the 2019 guidance to provide the FSOC more flexibility to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.
•SEC Rules Governing Security-Based Swaps: In December 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (“SBS”) transactions to require public reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts.
•SEC Proposed Rules on Private Fund Advisers: During 2022, the SEC proposed new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These include a series of proposed amendments to Form PF for registered investment advisers that: (1) add new required disclosures, (2) require advisers to file reports within one business day for certain significant events, (3) lower the threshold for large private equity adviser reporting, (4) increase reporting obligations on large liquidity fund advisers, and (5) enhance reporting on basic information about advisers and the funds they advise. The SEC proposed additional rules that would, among other things, require registered private fund advisers to: (1) provide quarterly reports to investors of fund performance, fees and expenses, (2) obtain an annual audit for each fund and (3) distribute to investors a fairness opinion and summary of certain material business relationships with the opinion provider in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction. The proposed rules would also prohibit private fund advisers from engaging in certain activities and practices deemed to be contrary to the public interest and investor protection, providing certain types of preferential terms for selected investors and providing any other forms of preferential treatment unless disclosed. These rules and amendments, if adopted as proposed, could significantly increase BlackRock’s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock’s alternatives products.
•SEC Rule 15c2-11: Rule 15c2-11 governs the submission of quotes into quotation systems by broker-dealers and has historically been applied to the OTC equity markets. However, the SEC has stated that it intends to apply the rule to fixed income securities. While SEC staff issued additional no-action relief in November 2022 delaying implementation of the rule to segments of the fixed income markets until 2025, full implementation may disrupt primary and secondary market liquidity.
•Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS: In January 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of “exchange” and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules may impact certain functionality and tools offered by Aladdin, which may increase compliance costs for BlackRock.
•Proposed US Treasury Clearing Mandate: In September 2022, the SEC proposed rules that would mandate central clearing of certain US Treasury transactions. If enacted as proposed, the rules would require many market participants, including a large number of BlackRock funds and accounts, to clear cash Treasury securities transactions and Treasury repurchase transactions through a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which could result in increased transaction costs for our clients.
Regulatory reforms in the US could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
BlackRock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the US and the Company may be affected by several proposed or implemented reform initiatives in the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific regions, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives internationally, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, key reforms in these regions include:
European Union
•EU Market Access and Outsourcing: The EU legislature continues to consider proposals amending both the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) and Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities fund frameworks. The proposed changes remain broadly consistent with the current regulatory framework but with increased notification requirements to national regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), enhanced liquidity management requirements and new requirements for loan originating funds. There is also a proposal to require notification for instances of significant delegation of portfolio management or risk management functions to entities located outside the EU. ESMA would then be required to present market analysis and supervisory peer review every two years to the European Parliament (“EP”). These proposals and any further regulatory actions could impact delegated activities, increase compliance costs and impact products and services offered to EU clients.
•Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms: The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, entered into force in January 2023, with the requirements expected to become applicable in January 2025. DORA will, among other things: (1) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. In parallel with DORA, the UK has signaled its intention to provide HMT powers to designate certain third parties to the financial sector as “critical” and subject them to oversight by UK regulators. This regime is expected to build on existing UK requirements regarding firms’ operational resilience and use of technology.
•Central Securities Depository Regulation: Aspects of the settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation came into effect in February 2022. These include rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions. However, the mandatory buy-in regime is delayed to June 2025. Implementation of the regime required new operational mechanisms to facilitate compliance, which may increase required resources and cost.
United Kingdom
•Review of Retained EU Law: Under the Financial Services and Markets Bill (the “FSM Bill”) introduced in July 2022, retained EU law relating to financial services and markets will be revoked and UK financial regulators will be delegated substantial rulemaking powers to amend and restate such retained laws. Several UK regimes are currently subject to regulatory changes as the UK considers changes to retained EU rules following the UK’s exit from the EU, including the Wholesale Markets Review of the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation frameworks, consumer disclosures, and the regime for non-UK-based funds that are recognized for sale into the UK, which is also currently under government review.
•Overseas Fund Regime (“OFR”): The OFR, the simplified regime through which non-UK funds can register with the FCA to be marketed to UK retail investors, was enacted in February 2022 and is expected to be implemented over the next two years. The OFR will require consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled to be found equivalent to the UK’s regime in order to market such funds in the UK.
•Conduct Regulation: The FCA continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the implementation of the Consumer Duty by all asset management firms, including BlackRock’s UK subsidiaries. The Consumer Duty rules require firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers in their manufacture and distribution of products and services, in respect of price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. The rules are expected to come into force in July 2023. Any failure to meet the FCA’s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk.
•Edinburgh Reforms: In December 2022, the UK announced wide-ranging reforms to financial services regulation which build on the FSM Bill, marking further potential divergence from EU regimes. Potential impacts to the asset management sector include: (1) repeal and replacement of the packaged retail and insurance based investment products (""PRIIPs"") Regulation; (2) review of the UK’s green finance strategy, including potential regulation of ESG data providers; (3) review of governance through the Senior Managers and Certification Regime; (4) repeal of EU legislation on the European Long-Term Investment Fund; (5) market infrastructure reforms; (6) reassessment of the boundary between investment advice and financial guidance; and (7) independent review of the UK investment research landscape.
Asia-Pacific
•Regulatory Environment in China: The Company’s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company’s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on the transfer of the Company’s Chinese onshore data to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock’s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock’s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance.
International regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financial and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US state and federal as well as non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the
past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock’s shareholders. Such legal proceedings could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.
In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.
Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may harm its business.
BlackRock’s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients, employees, shareholders and business partners. BlackRock’s reputation may be harmed by, among other factors, regulatory, enforcement or other governmental actions, technology or operational failures, poor investment performance, ineffective management or monitoring of key third-party relationships, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, privacy incidents, employee errors or misconduct, failures to manage risks or conflicts of interest, or legal actions related to BlackRock or its products and services. In addition, BlackRock’s business, scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders. This heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity and adverse actions for BlackRock and may continue to do so in the future. For example, different stakeholder groups have divergent views on ESG-related matters, including in the countries in which BlackRock operates and invests, as well as in states and localities where BlackRock serves public sector clients. This divergence has and continues to increase the risk that any perceived or actual action or lack thereof by BlackRock on such matters will be viewed differently by various stakeholders and adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business, including through redemptions or terminations by clients, and legal and governmental action and scrutiny. BlackRock’s global presence and investments on behalf of its clients around the world could also lead to heightened scrutiny and criticism in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape. For example, BlackRock has received criticism from some stakeholders because of its operations and investments on behalf of clients in certain countries, including China. These criticisms could adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business. In addition, the increasing popularity of social media and non-mainstream Internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of adverse publicity or inaccurate information about BlackRock, making effective remediation more difficult. Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may impact BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
A failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions and/or adversely affect BlackRock’s business and reputation, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
As a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients, the Company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. While BlackRock has policies, controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest, identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction, adverse publicity, litigation or enforcement actions. In particular, BlackRock’s broad range of investment, advisory and technology offerings, and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions, may result in clients working with multiple BlackRock businesses and/or BlackRock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. To the extent that BlackRock fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face adverse publicity, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, client attrition, penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
A subsidiary of BlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCC regulation and capital requirements that may limit its business activities. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank. Having a subsidiary subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to the limitations imposed by such regulation.
The implications of complying with threshold limits and/or any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation, impact the performance of certain BlackRock funds and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Of note among the various regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Moreover, as BlackRock’s business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory, industry-level or issuer-specific threshold limits that may prevent BlackRock from holding positions in certain equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds. Although BlackRock is actively engaged in regulatory, issuer-specific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity, threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may, in turn, impact the performance of certain BlackRock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds’ benchmarks and impact the performance of certain BlackRock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities.
BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the scale of its index investing business, as well as purported competition issues relating to the common ownership theory.
As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing and concentrated proxy voting power. Some commentators have argued that continued growth of index funds has the potential to impact stock market competitiveness by exacerbating stock price moves and market volatility. Some commentators, regulators and
lawmakers have also argued that index managers have accumulated outsized influence through the proxy voting power their clients have assigned them. Some have proposed limitations on the ability of index fund managers to vote on behalf of their clients, or that voting and engagement on certain topics should trigger changes in regulatory status. Additional commentary focuses on the common ownership theory, an academic theory stating that minority ownership of multiple companies within a single industry by the same investor leads to anticompetitive effects. This theory purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation and lower wages and employment rates, among other things. In the US, the FTC cited common ownership as a disqualifying factor in a proposed exemption from pre-merger notification rules and as a consideration underlying its consultation on rules applying to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities. In 2021, the FTC identified common ownership as a key enforcement area and passed a resolution empowering individual commissioners to investigate shareholder conduct in connection with common ownership. In 2022, the FTC and Antitrust Division of the DOJ solicited public input on changes to their merger guidelines, including a question on whether the guidelines’ approach to common ownership is adequate. Common ownership may be given greater consideration in FTC and DOJ investigations, studies, rule proposals, policy decisions and/or the scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions. The debate on common ownership is still on the agenda of competition regulators globally, and common ownership may continue to be a consideration for the European Commission (“EC”), among others, including in the assessment of mergers and investigations. For example, EC and EP reports in 2020 suggested that more evidence was required on the impact of common ownership on competition, and a committee of the Australian House of Representatives held an inquiry in 2021 on the implications of common ownership and capital concentration on Australian companies and markets. There is substantial literature casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with the common ownership theory and competition regulators, including at the FTC and the UK Competition & Markets Authority, have acknowledged that the debate around the theory remains unsettled. Nevertheless, some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on the ownership stakes of common owners that, if enacted into policy, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, as well as increase costs and limit the availability of products for investors. Such policy solutions could, in turn, adversely affect BlackRock.
New tax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on net stock repurchases. BlackRock does not expect the IRA to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In addition, legislation at both the US federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the EC has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15%. In December 2022, EU member states agreed to adopt the OECD’s minimum tax rules, which are expected to begin going into effect in 2024. Several other countries, including the UK, are also considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD’s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which we do business could change, and any such changes could increase our tax liabilities.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.",,,,,4994.0,,0.0,14:35:17,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
(1)As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated the definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans which the Company began economically hedging in 2023.
(2)Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity divided by total shares outstanding at March 31 of the respective period-end.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2022
GAAP. Operating income of $1.4 billion decreased $326 million and operating margin of 33.9% decreased 360 bps from the three months ended March 31, 2022. Decreases in operating income and operating margin reflected lower base fees, driven by the impact of lower markets and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, and lower performance fees, partially offset by lower expense.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) increased $169 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022, driven primarily by mark-to-market gains on the Company’s un-hedged seed capital and private equity co-investment portfolios, and higher interest and dividend income.
First quarter 2023 income tax expense included a $38 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2023, offset by a $38 million discrete tax expense related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. First quarter 2022 income tax expense included $133 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2022 and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. In addition, first quarter 2022 income tax expense included $18 million of net noncash tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share decreased $1.71, or 18%, from the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily reflecting lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher nonoperating income in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1.5 billion decreased $311 million and operating margin of 40.4% decreased 380 bps from the three months ended March 31, 2022. Earnings per diluted common share decreased $1.59, or 17%, from the three months ended March 31, 2022, reflecting lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher nonoperating income. Income tax expense, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2022 excluded $18 million of net noncash tax benefits described above.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated its definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to exclude the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, and the related nonoperating gain (loss) impact of an economic hedge of these deferred cash compensation plans. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated its definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to exclude the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, and the related nonoperating gain (loss) impact of an economic hedge of these deferred cash compensation plans.
Computations and reconciliations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:
(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:
(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted:
(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted:
(1)Non-GAAP adjustments are net of tax excluding income tax matters.
(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•Operating income, as adjusted, includes the following non-GAAP expense adjustments:
(a)Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred cash compensation plans. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, to exclude compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, which the Company began hedging economically in 2023. For these deferred cash compensation plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed to employees in cash upon vesting is determined based on the returns on specified investment funds. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the appreciation (depreciation) of the deferred cash compensation liability in proportion to the vested amount of the award during a respective period, while the gain (loss) to economically hedge these plans is immediately recognized in nonoperating income (expense), which creates a timing difference impacting net income. This timing difference will reverse and offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multi-year vesting period. Management believes excluding market valuation changes related to the deferred cash compensation plans in the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, provides useful disclosure to both management and investors of the Company’s financial performance over time as these amounts are economically hedged, while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(b)Acquisition related costs. Includes adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(c)Lease costs - New York. The Company began recording expenses in August 2021 related to the lease of office space for its new headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (“Lease cost - Hudson Yards”), when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. The Company will begin lease payments related to its new headquarters in May 2023. As a result, the Company continued to recognize lease expense within general and administration expense for both its new and prior headquarters until the Company's lease on its prior headquarters expired in April 2023. Prior to February 2023, the impact of Lease cost - Hudson Yards was excluded from operating income, as adjusted. Beginning in February 2023, when the Company completed the majority of its move to 50 Hudson Yards, it no longer excluded the impact of Lease cost - Hudson Yards and began to exclude the impact of lease costs related to the Company's prior headquarters for its remaining lease term. Management believes excluding the impact of these respective New York lease costs (“Lease costs - New York”) when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance, ongoing operations, and enhances comparability among periods presented.
•Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.
•Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.
(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, excludes the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of certain deferred cash compensation plans. As the gain (loss) on investments and derivatives used to hedge these compensation plans over time substantially offsets the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on these deferred cash compensation plans, which is included in operating income, GAAP basis, management believes excluding the gain (loss) impact of an economic hedge of these deferred cash compensation plans when calculating nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure for both management and investors of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value.
(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See notes (1) and (2) above regarding operating income, as adjusted, for information on the updated presentation of non-GAAP adjustments. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefit) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to enhance comparability among periods presented. The amounts for 2022 income tax matters included net noncash expense related to state and local income tax changes.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

(1)Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing four months.
(2)Amounts include commodity ETFs.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2022
Revenue decreased $456 million, or 10%, from the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily driven by the impact of lower markets and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements on average AUM and lower performance fees.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3.5 billion decreased $331 million from $3.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily driven by the negative impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by the elimination of yield-related fee waivers on money market funds and higher securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $167 million increased from $138 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $55 million decreased $43 million from $98 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, reflecting lower revenue from alternative products.
Technology services revenue of $340 million decreased $1 million from $341 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements on Aladdin’s non-dollar revenue and market declines on Aladdin’s fixed income platform assets over the last twelve months, offset by continued strong client demand for Aladdin.
Total advisory and other revenue of $27 million decreased $19 million from $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily reflecting lower volume of transition management assignments.
Expense
The following table presents expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2022
Expense decreased $130 million, or 4%, from the three months ended March 31, 2022, reflecting lower employee compensation and benefits expense and lower volume related expense, partially offset by higher general and administration expense.
Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $71 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily resulting from lower incentive compensation, largely driven by lower operating income.
Direct fund expense decreased $14 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily reflecting lower average index AUM.
General and administration expense increased $25 million from the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily driven by higher marketing and promotional expense, resulting from higher travel and entertainment expense, and higher occupancy and office related expense, partially offset by lower technology expense, related to the impact of certain credits.
Nonoperating Results
The summary of nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:
(1)Amount relates to the gain (loss) from economically hedging BlackRock’s deferred cash compensation plans.
(2)Management believes nonoperating income (expense), net of NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impacts BlackRock’s book value. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on other non-GAAP financial measures.
(3)Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to credit funds, direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions.
(4)Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to unhedged seed investments.
Income Tax Expense
(1)As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
(2)Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.
2023. Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included a $38 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2023, offset by a $38 million discrete tax expense related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") was enacted into law, which became effective January 1, 2023 and introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on net stock repurchases. The provisions within the IRA did not have a material impact on BlackRock's condensed consolidated financial statements.
2022. Income tax expense included $133 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2022 and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. In addition, first quarter 2022 GAAP income tax expense included $18 million of net noncash tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, which was excluded from our as adjusted results, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products (""CIPs"").
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom (""UK""), and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2022 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.
(1)Amounts represent segregated client assets and related liabilities, in which BlackRock has no economic interest. BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
(2)Amounts represent the impact of consolidating CIPs.
(3)Amount includes property and equipment and other assets.
(4)Amount includes approximately $4.3 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles.
The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 included $243 million and $265 million, respectively, of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended March 31, 2023). Accounts receivable at March 31, 2023 increased $316 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher base fee and technology services receivables. Investments at March 31, 2023 increased $706 million from December 31, 2022 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets at March 31, 2023 decreased $39 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets at March 31, 2023 increased $696 million from December 31, 2022, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a decrease in due from related parties.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at March 31, 2023 decreased $1.3 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily due to 2022 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by 2023 incentive compensation accruals. Other liabilities at March 31, 2023 increased $909 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets). Net deferred income tax liabilities at March 31, 2023 increased $62 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation, partially offset by capitalized costs.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $8.2 billion and $7.5 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred cash compensation investments and hedged exposures, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred cash compensation plans is substantially offset by a change in associated compensation expense, and the impact of the portfolio of seed investments is mitigated by futures entered into as part of the Company's macro hedging strategy. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.
(1)Amounts include $1.5 billion of carried interest (VIEs) as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure.
(2)Amounts exclude investments in strategic minority investments included in other assets on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:
(1)Amounts include seed investments in equity, fixed income, and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies.
(2)Other alternatives primarily include co-investments in credit funds, direct hedge fund strategies, and hedge fund solutions.
As adjusted investment activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was as follows:
(1)Amount includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.
(2)Amount includes the impact of foreign exchange movements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIPs:
Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred cash compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $249 million and primarily reflected $176 million of net investment purchases and $81 million of purchases of property and equipment.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $1.5 billion, primarily resulting from $796 million of cash dividend payments, $721 million of share repurchases, including $375 million in open market transactions and $346 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Liquidity resources at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were as follows:
(1)The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
(2)The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s US subsidiaries was approximately 40% and 50% at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.
Total liquidity resources decreased $1.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2022 year-end incentive awards, cash dividend payments of $796 million, and share repurchases of $721 million, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities and a $300 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount under the credit facility.
A significant portion of the Company’s $6.8 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. In January 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for a total of up to approximately 7.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock.
During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 0.5 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $375 million. At March 31, 2023, there were approximately 7.4 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.2 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2023 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the “2023 credit facility”). In March 2023, the 2023 credit facility was amended to, among other things, (1) increase the aggregate commitment amount by $300 million to $5 billion, (2) extend the maturity date to March 2028 and (3) change the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) adjustment to 10 bps per annum for all SOFR-based loans. The 2023 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2023 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $6 billion. The 2023 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2023, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2023 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2023 credit facility. At March 31, 2023, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At March 31, 2023, the principal amount of long-term notes outstanding was $6.7 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2022 Form 10-K for more information on overall borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company paid approximately $51 million of interest on long-term notes. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at March 31, 2023 were as follows:
(1)The amounts related to the 2025 Notes are calculated using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of March 31, 2023.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At March 31, 2023, the Company had $836 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity funds and real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Critical Accounting Policies And Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2022 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once its economic interest falls below 10%. As of March 31, 2023, the Company was deemed to be the PB of 92 VIEs. See Note 5, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Fair Value Disclosures, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts (“SMAs”). These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold at the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgment is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to (a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or (b) distribute their sales proceeds and determine the timing of such distributions.
The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 15, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.","Item 1A.

65,2023-05-18,,,,,,,,,,,1169.0," Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement On , BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which BlackRock agreed to sell to the Underwriters $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% Notes due 2033, for resale by the Underwriters (the “Offering”) pursuant to BlackRock’s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-255156). The Offering is expected to result in net proceeds to BlackRock of approximately $1,231,925,000. BlackRock intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of all or a portion of its outstanding 3.50% Notes due 2024. The Underwriters and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial lending, financial advisory and other services for BlackRock. The Underwriters have received customary fees and expenses for these services.

66,2023-05-25,,,,,,,,,,,1169.0," Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant On , BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock” or the “Company”) completed its underwritten public offering of $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% Notes due 2033 (the “Notes”) pursuant to BlackRock’s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-255156). The Notes were issued pursuant to the Senior Indenture, dated as of , between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as trustee (the “Indenture”). Prior to  (three (3) months prior to the Notes’ maturity date), the Company may redeem the Notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a “make-whole” redemption price (calculated as set forth in the Notes), plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On or after  (three (3) months prior to the Notes’ maturity date), the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
(1)Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
(2)As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated the definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans which the Company began economically hedging in 2023.
(3)Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity divided by total shares outstanding at June 30 of the respective period-end.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2022
GAAP. Operating income of $1.6 billion decreased $53 million and operating margin of 36.2% decreased 70 bps from the three months ended June 30, 2022. Decreases in operating income and operating margin reflected lower investment advisory and administration fees (collectively ""base fees""), driven by the negative impact of market movements on average AUM over the past twelve months.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) increased $427 million from the three months ended June 30, 2022, driven primarily by mark-to-market gains on the Company’s private equity co-investment portfolios, mark-to-market revaluation of un-hedged seed capital portfolio and certain minority company investments, and higher interest and dividend income.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $2.00, or 28%, from the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by higher nonoperating income in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1.7 billion decreased $52 million and operating margin of 42.5% decreased 120 bps from the three months ended June 30, 2022, while earnings per diluted common share increased $1.92, or 26%, from the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher nonoperating income.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2022
GAAP. Operating income of $3.1 billion decreased $379 million and operating margin of 35.1% decreased 210 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2022. Decreases in operating income and operating margin reflected lower base fees, driven by the impact of lower markets, partially offset by lower expense.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI increased $596 million from the six months ended June 30, 2022, driven primarily by higher mark-to-market gains on the Company’s private equity co-investment portfolios, mark-to-market revaluation of Company's un-hedged seed capital portfolio and certain minority company investments, and higher interest and dividend income.
Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 included $40 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2023, offset by a $38 million discrete tax expense related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included $133 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2022 and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters, and $18 million of net noncash tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $0.27 or 2%, from the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher nonoperating income, partially offset by lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $3.2 billion decreased $363 million and operating margin of 41.5% decreased 240 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2022.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $0.32, or 2%, from the six months ended June 30, 2022. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 excluded the $18 million net noncash benefit described above.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated its definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to exclude the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, and the related nonoperating gain (loss) impact of an economic hedge of these deferred cash compensation plans. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP.
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP financial measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated its definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to exclude the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, and the related nonoperating gain (loss) impact of an economic hedge of these deferred cash compensation plans.
Computations and reconciliations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:
(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:
(1)Amount included within general and administration expense.
(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted:
(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted:
(1)Non-GAAP adjustments are net of tax excluding income tax matters.
(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•Operating income, as adjusted, includes the following non-GAAP expense adjustments:
(a)Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred cash compensation plans. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, to exclude compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, which the Company began hedging economically in 2023. For these deferred cash compensation plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed to employees in cash upon vesting is determined based on the returns on specified investment funds. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the appreciation (depreciation) of the deferred cash compensation liability in proportion to the vested amount of the award during a respective period, while the gain (loss) to economically hedge these plans is immediately recognized in nonoperating income (expense), which creates a timing difference impacting net income. This timing difference will reverse and offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multi-year vesting period. Management believes excluding market valuation changes related to the deferred cash compensation plans in the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, provides useful disclosure to both management and investors of the Company’s financial performance over time as these amounts are economically hedged, while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(b)Acquisition related costs. Acquisition related costs include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(c)Lease costs - New York. In 2022 and 2023, the Company continued to recognize lease expense within general and administration expense for both its current headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York and prior headquarters until the Company's lease on its prior headquarters expired in April 2023. The Company began lease payments related to its current headquarters in May 2023, but began recording lease expense in August 2021 when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. Prior to the Company’s move to its current headquarters in February 2023, the impact of lease costs related to 50 Hudson Yards was excluded from operating income, as adjusted. In February 2023, the Company completed the majority of its move to 50 Hudson Yards and no longer excluded the impact of these lease costs. Subsequently, from February 2023 through April 2023, the Company excluded the impact of lease costs related to the Company's prior headquarters. Management believes excluding the impact of these respective New York lease costs (“Lease costs - New York”) when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and ongoing operations, and enhances comparability among periods presented.
•Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.
(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, excludes the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of certain deferred cash compensation plans. As the gain (loss) on investments and derivatives used to hedge these compensation plans over time substantially offsets the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on these deferred cash compensation plans, which is included in operating income, GAAP basis, management believes excluding the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of the deferred cash compensation plans when calculating nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure for both management and investors of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value.
(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See notes (1) and (2) above regarding operating income, as adjusted, for information on the updated presentation of non-GAAP adjustments. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefit) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to enhance comparability among periods presented.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2022
Revenue decreased $63 million, or 1%, from the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by lower base fees due to the impact of lower markets on average AUM.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3.6 billion decreased $77 million from $3.7 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by the negative impact of market beta on average AUM over the last twelve months, partially offset by higher securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $184 million increased from $160 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $118 million increased $12 million from $106 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher revenue from illiquid alternative products.
Technology services revenue of $359 million increased $27 million from $332 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting continued strong client demand for Aladdin but also the impact of fixed income market movements over the last twelve months on positions on the Aladdin platform.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2022
Revenue decreased $519 million, or 6%, from the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by the impact of lower markets on average AUM.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $7.1 billion decreased $408 million from $7.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by the negative impact of market beta on average AUM, partially offset by the elimination of yield-related fee waivers on money market funds and higher securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $351 million increased from $298 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $173 million decreased $31 million from $204 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting lower revenue from long-only fixed income products and liquid alternative products.
Technology services revenue of $699 million increased $26 million from $673 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting continued strong client demand for Aladdin but also the impact of fixed income market movements over the last twelve months on positions on the Aladdin platform.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2022
Expense decreased $10 million from the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting lower distribution and servicing costs due to lower average AUM, partially offset by higher direct fund expense and employee compensation and benefits expense.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $15 million from the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting higher base compensation, driven primarily by base salary increases, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, primarily as a result of lower operating income.

Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $56 million from the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily resulting from lower incentive compensation, largely driven by lower operating income, partially offset by higher base compensation, driven primarily by base salary increases.
Direct fund expense increased $26 million from the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM.
General and administration expense increased $15 million from the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by higher marketing and promotional expense, resulting from higher travel and entertainment expense, partially offset by lower technology expense, related to the impact of certain credits.
Nonoperating Results
The summary of nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:
(1)Amount relates to the gain (loss) from economically hedging BlackRock's deferred cash compensation plans.
(2)Management believes nonoperating income (expense), net of NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impacts BlackRock’s book value. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on other non-GAAP financial measures.
(3)Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to credit funds, direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions.
(4)Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to unhedged seed investments.
(5)Amounts primarily include noncash pre-tax gains related to the revaluation of certain minority strategic investments.
Income Tax Expense
(1)As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
(2)Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.
2023. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 included $40 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2023, offset by a $38 million discrete tax expense related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") was enacted into law, which became effective January 1, 2023 and introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on net stock repurchases. The provisions within the IRA did not have a material impact on BlackRock's condensed consolidated financial statements.
2022. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included $133 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. In addition, GAAP income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included $18 million of net noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, which was excluded from our as adjusted results, as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products (""CIPs"").
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom (""UK""), and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2022 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.
(1)Amounts represent segregated client assets and related liabilities, in which BlackRock has no economic interest. BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
(2)Amounts represent the impact of consolidating CIPs.
(3)Amount includes property and equipment and other assets.
(4)Amount includes approximately $4.3 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles.
The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2023 included $256 million of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended June 30, 2023). Accounts receivable at June 30, 2023 increased $542 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher base fee and technology services receivables. Investments at June 30, 2023 increased $1.7 billion from December 31, 2022 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets at June 30, 2023 decreased $77 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets at June 30, 2023 increased $2.4 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a decrease in due from related parties.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at June 30, 2023 decreased $898 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to 2022 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by 2023 incentive compensation accruals. Other liabilities at June 30, 2023 increased $2.6 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets) and an increase in the deferred carried interest liability. Net deferred income tax liabilities at June 30, 2023 increased $58 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $9.1 billion and $7.5 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred cash compensation investments and hedged exposures, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred cash compensation plans is substantially offset by a change in associated compensation expense, and the impact of the portfolio of seed investments is mitigated by futures entered into as part of the Company's macro hedging strategy. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.
(1)Amounts included $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion of carried interest (VIEs) as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure.
(2)Amounts do not include investments in strategic minority investments included in other assets on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.
The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:
(1)Amounts include seed investments in equity, fixed-income, and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies.
(2)Other alternatives primarily include co-investments in credit funds, direct hedge fund strategies, and hedge fund solutions.
As adjusted investment activity for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was as follows:
(1)Amount includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.
(2)Amount includes the impact of foreign exchange movements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIPs:
Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends and repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred cash compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $530 million and primarily reflected $405 million of net investment purchases and $142 million of purchases of property and equipment.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $1.4 billion, primarily resulting from $1.5 billion of cash dividend payments, and $1.1 billion of share repurchases, including $0.8 billion in open market transactions and $0.3 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, partially offset by $1.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Liquidity resources at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were as follows:
(1)The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
(2)The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s US subsidiaries was approximately 50% at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.
Total liquidity resources decreased $273 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2022 year-end incentive awards, cash dividend payments of $1.5 billion and share repurchases of $1.1 billion, partially offset by $1.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings, cash flows from other operating activities and a $300 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount under the credit facility.
A significant portion of the Company’s $7.4 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. In January 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the Company's existing share repurchase program for a total of up to approximately 7.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock.
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 1.1 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $750 million. At June 30, 2023, there were approximately 6.8 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2023 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the “2023 credit facility”). In March 2023, the 2023 credit facility was amended to, among other things, (1) increase the aggregate commitment amount by $300 million to $5 billion, (2) extend the maturity date to March 2028 and (3) change the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) adjustment to 10 bps per annum for all SOFR-based borrowings. The 2023 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2023 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $6 billion. The 2023 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at June 30, 2023. At June 30, 2023, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2023 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2023 credit facility. At June 30, 2023, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At June 30, 2023, the principal amount of long-term notes outstanding was $8.0 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2022 Form 10-K for more information on overall borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company paid approximately $89 million of interest on long-term notes. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at June 30, 2023 were as follows:
(1)The amounts related to the 2025 Notes are calculated using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of June 30, 2023.
In May 2023, the Company issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior unsecured notes maturing on May 25, 2033 (the “2033 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2033 Notes are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include the future repayment of all or a portion of the $1.0 billion 3.50% Notes maturing in March 2024. Interest of approximately $59 million per year is payable semi-annually on May 25 and November 25 of each year, commencing on November 25, 2023. The 2033 Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time prior to February 25, 2033 at a ""make-whole"" redemption price, or thereafter at 100% of the principal amount of the 2033 Notes, in each case plus accrued but unpaid interest. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2033 Notes.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At June 30, 2023, the Company had $797 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity funds and real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Acquisition. In August 2023, BlackRock completed the acquisition of Kreos Capital, a leading provider of growth and venture debt financing to companies in the technology and healthcare industries. The Company believes this acquisition will add to the Company's position as a leading global credit asset manager and advance its ambitions to provide clients with a diverse range of private market investment products and solutions. The financial impact of the transaction is not expected to be material to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2022 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once its economic interest falls below 10%. As of June 30, 2023, the Company was deemed to be the PB of 94 VIEs. See Note 5, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Fair Value Disclosures, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts (""SMAs""). These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold at the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgment is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to (a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or (b) distribute their sales proceeds and determine the timing of such distributions.
The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees and other third parties. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 15, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.","Item 1A.

(1)Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
(2)As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated the definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans which the Company began economically hedging in 2023.
(3)Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity divided by total shares outstanding at September 30 of the respective period-end.
Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2022
GAAP. Operating income of $1.6 billion increased $111 million and operating margin of 36.2% increased 80 bps from the three months ended September 30, 2022. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected higher investment advisory and administration fees (collectively ""base fees""), primarily driven by organic base fee growth and the impact of market movements over the past twelve months on average AUM, and higher technology services revenue.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) decreased $30 million from the three months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting the impact of $267 million of noncash gains related to BlackRock's strategic minority investment in iCapital Network, Inc. (""iCapital"") during 2022, partially offset by higher mark-to-market revaluation of the Company's seed capital portfolio, net of impact of certain hedges, higher gains on private equity co-investment portfolios, and higher interest and dividend income during the three months ended September 30, 2023.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.41, or 15%, from the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by higher operating income and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower nonoperating income. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 included approximately $223 million and $93 million, respectively, of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1.7 billion increased $106 million and operating margin of 42.3% increased 30 bps from the three months ended September 30, 2022. Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.36, or 14%, from the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher operating income and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower nonoperating income.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022
GAAP. Operating income of $4.7 billion decreased $268 million and operating margin of 35.5% decreased 110 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Decreases in operating income and operating margin reflected lower base fees, driven by the impact of lower markets, partially offset by higher technology expense.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI increased $566 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2022, driven primarily by higher mark-to-market gains on the Company’s private equity co-investment portfolios, higher mark-to-market revaluation of Company's seed capital portfolio, net of impact of certain hedges, and higher interest and dividend income, partially offset by the impact of $267 million of noncash gains related to BlackRock's strategic minority investment in iCapital during 2022.
Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included $226 million discrete tax net benefits related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters and stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2023. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included $226 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2022 and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters, and $18 million of net noncash tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.69 or 7%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher nonoperating income, partially offset by lower operating income.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $4.9 billion decreased $257 million and operating margin of 41.8% decreased 150 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.68, or 6%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 excluded the $18 million net noncash benefit described above.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated its definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, nonoperating income (expense), as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to exclude the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, and the related nonoperating gain (loss) impact of an economic hedge of these deferred cash compensation plans. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP.
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP financial measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

(1)Non-GAAP adjustments, excluding income tax matters, are net of tax.
(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•Operating income, as adjusted, includes the following non-GAAP expense adjustments:
(a)Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred cash compensation plans. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, to exclude compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, which the Company began hedging economically in 2023. For these deferred cash compensation plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed to employees in cash upon vesting is determined based on the returns on specified investment funds. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the appreciation (depreciation) of the deferred cash compensation liability in proportion to the vested amount of the award during a respective period, while the gain (loss) to economically hedge these plans is immediately recognized in nonoperating income (expense), which creates a timing difference impacting net income. This timing difference will reverse and offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multi-year vesting period. Management believes excluding market valuation changes related to the deferred cash compensation plans in the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, provides useful disclosure to both management and investors of the Company’s financial performance over time as these amounts are economically hedged, while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(b)Acquisition related costs. Acquisition related costs include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(c)Lease costs - New York. In 2022 and 2023, the Company continued to recognize lease expense within general and administration expense for both its current headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York and prior headquarters until the Company's lease on its prior headquarters expired in April 2023. The Company began lease payments related to its current headquarters in May 2023, but began recording lease expense in August 2021 when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. Prior to the Company’s move to its current headquarters in February 2023, the impact of lease costs related to 50 Hudson Yards was excluded from operating income, as adjusted. In February 2023, the Company completed the majority of its move to 50 Hudson Yards and no longer excluded the impact of these lease costs. Subsequently, from February 2023 through April 2023, the Company excluded the impact of lease costs related to the Company's prior headquarters. Management believes excluding the impact of these respective New York lease costs (“Lease costs - New York”) when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and ongoing operations, and enhances comparability among periods presented.
(d)Reduction of indemnification asset. In connection with a previous acquisition, BlackRock recorded an $8 million indemnification asset. Due to the resolution of certain tax matters in the current quarter, BlackRock recorded $8 million of general and administration expense to reflect the reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $8 million tax benefit. The $8 million general and administrative expense and $8 million tax benefit have been excluded from as adjusted results as there is no impact on BlackRock’s book value.
•Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.
(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, excludes the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of certain deferred cash compensation plans. As the gain (loss) on investments and derivatives used to hedge these compensation plans over time substantially offsets the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on these deferred cash compensation plans, which is included in operating income, GAAP basis, management believes excluding the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of the deferred cash compensation plans when calculating nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure for both management and investors of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value.
(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
See notes (1) and (2) above regarding operating income, as adjusted, for information on the updated presentation of non-GAAP adjustments. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefit) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to enhance comparability among periods presented.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.
ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT
AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

(4)Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM decreased $324 billion to $9.1 trillion at September 30, 2023 from $9.4 trillion at June 30, 2023, driven primarily by net market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign exchange movement.
Long-term net outflows of $13 billion were comprised of net outflows of $38 billion and $4 billion from institutional and retail clients, respectively, partially offset by net inflows of $29 billion into ETFs. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•Institutional index net outflows of $36 billion primarily reflected $49 billion of net outflows from lower-fee institutional index equity strategies, including $19 billion from a single international client, partially offset by fixed income net inflows.
•Institutional active net outflows of $1 billion primarily reflected fixed income net outflows, impacted by client-specific partial redemptions, including reinsurance activity, partially offset by multi-asset net inflows, reflecting continued demand for target-date strategies.
•Retail net outflows of $4 billion primarily reflected net outflows from liquid alternatives.
•ETFs net inflows of $29 billion were led by net inflows into core equity and bond ETFs, partially offset by redemptions from precision ETFs.
Cash management AUM increased to $724 billion, driven by net inflows into US government money market funds.
Net market depreciation of $258 billion was primarily driven by global equity and fixed income market depreciation.
AUM decreased $71 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound, the euro and the Japanese yen.

AUM increased $506 billion to $9.1 trillion at September 30, 2023 from $8.6 trillion at December 31, 2022, driven by net market appreciation and net inflows, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movement.
Long-term net inflows of $147 billion were comprised of net inflows of $98 billion and $48 billion from ETFs and institutional clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•ETFs net inflows of $98 billion were led by $81 billion and $23 billion of net inflows into fixed income and equity ETFs, respectively. ETFs net inflows also included $77 billion and $51 billion of net inflows into strategic and core equity, respectively, partially offset by $30 billion in redemptions from precision ETFs.
•Institutional active net inflows of $80 billion were led by multi-asset net inflows and included the impact of significant outsourcing mandates.
•Institutional index net outflows of $32 billion primarily reflected net outflows from lower-fee institutional index equity strategies, including $19 billion from a single international client in the third quarter, partially offset by fixed income net inflows.
Cash management AUM increased to $724 billion, due to net inflows into US government money market funds.
Net market appreciation of $362 billion was primarily driven by global equity market appreciation.
AUM decreased $50 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Japanese yen.

(1)Amounts include AUM attributable to the Kreos Transaction.
(2)Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(3)Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
(4)Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM increased $1.1 trillion to $9.1 trillion at September 30, 2023 from $8.0 trillion at September 30, 2022, driven by net market appreciation, net inflows, and the positive impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $292 billion were comprised of net inflows of $188 billion and $119 billion from ETFs and institutional clients, respectively, partially offset by retail net outflows of $14 billion. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•ETFs net inflows of $188 billion were driven by net inflows into bond and core equity ETFs.
•Institutional active net inflows of $156 billion were led by multi-asset and fixed income net inflows and included the impact of several significant outsourcing mandates.
•Institutional index net outflows of $37 billion primarily reflected $72 billion of equity net outflows, partially offset by $37 billion of fixed income net inflows.
•Retail net outflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by net outflows from liquid alternatives.
Cash management AUM increased to $724 billion due to net inflows into US government money market funds.
Net market appreciation of $736 billion was driven by global equity market appreciation.
AUM increased $95 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar largely against the British pound and euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the Japanese yen.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2022
Revenue increased $211 million, or 5%, from the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by higher base fees due to the impact of organic growth and market movements over the past twelve months on average AUM and higher technology service revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3.7 billion increased $150 million from $3.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by organic base fee growth and the impact of market and foreign exchange movements over the past twelve months on average AUM. Securities lending revenue of $167 million increased from $162 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.
Investment advisory performance fees of $70 million decreased $12 million from $82 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily reflecting lower revenue from illiquid alternative products, partially offset by higher revenue from long-only and liquid alternative products.
Technology services revenue of $407 million increased $69 million from $338 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, driven by sustained demand for our technology offerings. Current quarter technology services revenue also benefited from the impact of several large client renewals of eFront on-premise licenses, for which a majority of the revenue is recognized at the time of renewal.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022
Revenue decreased $308 million, or 2%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by the impact of lower markets on average AUM and lower performance fees, partially offset by higher technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $10.8 billion decreased $258 million from $11.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by the negative impact of market beta on average AUM, partially offset by higher securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $518 million increased from $460 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $243 million decreased $43 million from $286 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily reflecting lower revenue from illiquid alternative and long-only fixed income products, partially offset by higher revenue from long-only equity products.
Technology services revenue of $1.1 billion increased $95 million from $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting sustained demand for our technology offerings but also the impact of fixed income market movements over the last twelve months on positions on the Aladdin platform. Current period technology services revenue also benefited from the impact of several large client renewals of eFront on-premise licenses, for which a majority of the revenue is recognized at the time of renewal.

2023. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included approximately $223 million of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included approximately $185 million of discrete tax net benefits related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters and $41 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2023.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") was enacted into law, which became effective January 1, 2023 and introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on net stock repurchases. The provisions within the IRA did not have a material impact on BlackRock's condensed consolidated financial statements.
2022. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 included approximately $93 million of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included $139 million of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters and $87 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2022. In addition, GAAP income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included $18 million of net noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products (""CIPs"").
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom (""UK""), and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2022 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2023 included $322 million of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended September 30, 2023). Accounts receivable at September 30, 2023 increased $622 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher base fee and technology services receivables. Investments at September 30, 2023 increased $2.4 billion from December 31, 2022 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets at September 30, 2023 increased $164 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to the Kreos Transaction, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets. Other assets at September 30, 2023 increased $1.5 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a decrease in due from related parties.
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at September 30, 2023 decreased $476 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to 2022 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by 2023 incentive compensation accruals. Other liabilities at September 30, 2023 increased $1.9 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets) and an increase in the deferred carried interest liability. Net deferred income tax liabilities at September 30, 2023 increased $67 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation and the Kreos Transaction.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $9.8 billion and $7.5 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred cash compensation investments and hedged exposures, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred cash compensation plans is substantially offset by a change in associated compensation expense, and the impact of the portfolio of seed investments is mitigated by futures entered into as part of the Company's macro hedging strategy. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends and repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred cash compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $794 million and primarily reflected $411 million of net investment purchases, $220 million of purchases of property and equipment, and $189 million related to the Kreos Transaction.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $2.5 billion, primarily resulting from $2.3 billion of cash dividend payments, and $1.5 billion of share repurchases, including $1.1 billion in open market transactions and $0.4 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, partially offset by $1.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements.

(1)The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
(2)The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s US subsidiaries was approximately 55% and 50% at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.
Total liquidity resources increased $143 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting cash flows from other operating activities, $1.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings and a $300 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount under the credit facility, partially offset by cash dividend payments of $2.3 billion, share repurchases of $1.5 billion and $189 million related to the Kreos Transaction.
A significant portion of the Company’s $7.7 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. In January 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the Company's existing share repurchase program for a total of up to approximately 7.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal limitations, price and market conditions.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 1.6 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $1.1 billion. At September 30, 2023, there were approximately 6.3 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2023 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the “2023 credit facility”). In March 2023, the 2023 credit facility was amended to, among other things, (1) increase the aggregate commitment amount by $300 million to $5 billion, (2) extend the maturity date to March 2028 and (3) change the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) adjustment to 10 bps per annum for all SOFR-based borrowings. The 2023 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2023 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $6 billion. The 2023 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2023, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2023 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2023 credit facility. At September 30, 2023, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Long-Term Borrowings
At September 30, 2023, the principal amount of long-term notes outstanding was $7.9 billion. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the 2022 Form 10-K for more information on overall borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid approximately $140 million of interest on long-term notes. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at September 30, 2023 were as follows:

(1)The amounts related to the 2025 Notes are calculated using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of September 30, 2023.
In May 2023, the Company issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior unsecured notes maturing on May 25, 2033 (the “2033 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2033 Notes are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include the future repayment of all or a portion of the $1.0 billion 3.50% Notes maturing in March 2024. Interest of approximately $59 million per year is payable semi-annually on May 25 and November 25 of each year, commencing on November 25, 2023. The 2033 Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time prior to February 25, 2033 at a ""make-whole"" redemption price, or thereafter at 100% of the principal amount of the 2033 Notes, in each case plus accrued but unpaid interest. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2033 Notes.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At September 30, 2023, the Company had $774 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity funds and real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2022 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once its economic interest falls below 10%. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was deemed to be the PB of 109 VIEs. See Note 5, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Fair Value Disclosures, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts (""SMAs""). These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold at the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgment is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to (a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or (b) distribute their sales proceeds and determine the timing of such distributions.
The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed
consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees and other third parties. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 15, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.","Item 1A.

75,2024-01-12,,,,,,,," Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities As previously announced, on , BlackRock, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a definitive agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) to acquire 100% of the business and assets of Global Infrastructure Management, LLC (referred to herein as Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”)), a leading independent infrastructure fund manager, for a total consideration of $3 billion in cash and approximately 12 million shares of New Parent (as defined below) common stock (the “Transaction”). Approximately 30% of the total consideration, all in stock, will be deferred and will be issued subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing events. As described below under Item 8.01 of this report, closing of the Transaction is subject to customary conditions, including, among others, the receipt of specified regulatory approvals. The shares of New Parent common stock will be issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Other Events Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Company will acquire the business and assets of GIP by first effecting a merger in accordance with Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. A direct wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”) of a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“New Parent”), will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of New Parent (the “New Parent Merger”). Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the New Parent Merger (other than shares of common stock held in treasury by the Company not held on behalf of a third party, which shares will be cancelled) will be converted into one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of New Parent. Following the New Parent Merger, New Parent will become the publicly listed company with the name “BlackRock, Inc.” and will acquire all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of GIP for a total consideration of $3 billion in cash and approximately 12 million shares of New Parent common stock. Approximately 30% of the total consideration, all in stock, will be deferred and will be issued subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing events. The Company intends to fund the cash consideration through $3 billion of additional debt. The Transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024. Consummation of the Transaction is subject to customary conditions, including, among others: (i) the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of specified other regulatory approvals and clearances; (ii) the absence of any law or order of any applicable governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that would prevent, enjoin, restrain or make illegal the consummation of the Transaction; (iii) satisfaction of covenant and representation and warranty bring-down conditions and receipt of certificates from the applicable party certifying the satisfaction of such conditions; (iv) the listing of common stock of New Parent on the New York Stock Exchange; and (v) the absence of a material adverse effect on GIP or the Company. The Company and GIP have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants. The Transaction Agreement contains, subject to applicable insurance policies, customary indemnification obligations for transactions of this type with respect to breaches of representations, warranties and covenants and certain other specified matters.

Overview
BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $10.0 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2023. With approximately 19,800 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.
BlackRock’s diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to offer choice and tailor investment and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® and BlackRock exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), separate accounts, collective trust funds and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin®, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, and Cachematrix, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients. The Company is highly regulated and manages its clients’ assets as a fiduciary. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.
BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management and technology service relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through third-party distribution relationships, including financial professionals and pension consultants.
BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over 85% of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors.
Management seeks to deliver value for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on BlackRock’s differentiated competitive position, including:
•the Company’s longstanding model of client choice, through which it offers a wide range of index, active, and whole portfolio solutions across broad markets, themes, regions, and investment styles;
•the Company's focus on strong investment performance, seeking the best risk-adjusted returns for client portfolios, within the mandates given by clients, to help them meet their investment objectives;
•the Company's research, data and analytics, which are at the center of BlackRock's investment approach and processes. They inform BlackRock's pursuit of the best risk-adjusted returns, and underpin product creation and innovation;
•the Company’s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 55% of employees outside the United States (“US”) serving clients locally and supporting local investment capabilities. Approximately 40% of total AUM is managed for clients domiciled outside the US;
•the Company’s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and industry trends including the secular shift to ETFs; growing allocations to private markets, such as infrastructure and private credit; increasing demand for outsourcing and whole portfolio solutions using index, active and illiquid alternatives products; anticipated re-allocations to fixed income; demand for high-performing active strategies; interest in sustainable investment strategies; and a continued focus on income and retirement; and
•the Company’s longstanding commitment to innovation, technology services and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock technology products and solutions, including Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, and Cachematrix. This commitment is further extended by minority investments in financial technology and digital distribution providers, data and whole portfolio capabilities including Upvest, Avaloq, Human Interest, Circle, SpiderRock Advisors, Clarity AI, Envestnet, Acorns, Scalable Capital and iCapital.
BlackRock operates in a global marketplace impacted by changing market dynamics and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.
The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in Aladdin and other technology products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives, in a manner consistent with their risk preferences, to deliver excellent client service and to innovate in technology to serve clients’ evolving needs. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain qualified professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.

(2)BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for all prior periods to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. In addition, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated the definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans which the Company began economically hedging in 2023. For further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2023 and 2022, see Item 7.

(1)Amounts include the following: (a) net AUM from the acquisition of Aperio Group, LLC (“Aperio Transaction”) in February 2021, and (b) net AUM from the acquisition of Kreos Capital in August 2023 (the “Kreos Transaction”).
AUM represents the broad range of financial assets managed for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which BlackRock provides risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that the Company is retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.
Investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. BlackRock also earns performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, the Company also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, implementation go-lives and software solution delivery and support.
At December 31, 2023, total AUM was $10.0 trillion, representing a CAGR of 11% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including the net AUM impact from the Aperio Transaction, which added $41.3 billion of AUM in February 2021, and the Kreos Transaction, which added $2.2 billion of AUM in August 2023. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.
The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:

Client Type
BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, with a regionally focused business model. BlackRock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment, risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent.
Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.
ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections.

Retail
BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of products across the investment spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Technology solutions, digital distribution tools and a shift toward portfolio construction are increasing the number of financial advisors and end-retail investors using BlackRock products.
Retail represented 10% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2023 and 31% of long-term investment advisory and administration fees (collectively “base fees”) and securities lending revenue for 2023.
ETFs have a significant retail component but are shown separately below. With the exclusion of ETFs, the majority of retail AUM is comprised of active mutual funds. In the aggregate, active and index mutual funds totaled $705 billion, or approximately 75%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. Approximately 75% of retail long-term AUM is invested in active products.

The retail client base is diversified geographically, with 69% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 26% in EMEA and 5% in Asia-Pacific at year-end 2023.
•US retail long-term net outflows of $5 billion were driven by outflows from alternatives, fixed income and multi-asset of $6 billion, $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, partially offset by equity net inflows of $5 billion. Alternatives and fixed income net outflows were primarily from rising-rate-sensitive strategies, including event driven, multi-strategy credit and unconstrained bond funds. Multi-asset net outflows were driven by world allocation and multi-asset income strategies. Equity net inflows of $5 billion reflected flows in Aperio, BlackRock’s customized index equity solution.
•International retail long-term net outflows of $4 billion were driven by alternatives and equity net outflows of $2 billion each, primarily due to redemptions from event driven and unconstrained strategies.
ETFs
BlackRock is the leading ETF provider in the world with $3.5 trillion of AUM as of December 31, 2023. BlackRock generated ETF net inflows of $186 billion in 2023. The majority of ETF AUM and net inflows represent the Company’s index-tracking iShares-branded ETFs. The Company also offers active BlackRock-branded ETFs that seek outperformance and/or differentiated outcomes and certain iShares-branded ETFs that seek defined outcomes.
Fixed income ETF net inflows of $112 billion were diversified across exposures, led by flows into treasury, core and corporate credit ETFs. Equity ETF net inflows of $81 billion were driven by flows into core ETFs, as well as continued client use of BlackRock’s broad-based precision exposure ETFs to express risk preferences and make tactical allocation changes during the year. Alternative ETFs had net outflows of $6 billion, primarily driven by commodities funds.
ETFs represented 38% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2023 and 43% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023.

(1)Amounts include AUM attributable to the Kreos Transaction.
Institutional active AUM ended 2023 at $1.9 trillion, reflecting $87 billion of net inflows, driven by the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates and continued growth in our LifePath® target-date and private markets platforms.
Multi-asset net inflows of $86 billion reflected continued growth from significant pension outsourcing mandates and LifePath target-date offerings. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion similarly reflected the funding of insurance outsourcing mandates. Equity net outflows of $13 billion were primarily from quantitative equity strategies.
Alternatives net inflows of $10 billion were led by infrastructure, private credit and private equity. Excluding return of capital and investment of $7 billion, alternatives net inflows were $17 billion. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $32 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments to deploy for institutional clients, which is not included in AUM.
Institutional active represented 21% of long-term AUM and 19% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023.
Institutional index AUM totaled $2.9 trillion at December 31, 2023, reflecting $55 billion of net outflows, driven by equities.
Institutional index represented 31% of long-term AUM and 7% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023.
The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:
•Pensions, Foundations and Endowments BlackRock is among the world’s largest managers of pension plan assets with $3.0 trillion, or 63%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2023. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, and our defined contribution channel represented $1.5 trillion of total pension AUM. BlackRock remains well positioned for the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $83 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.
•Official Institutions BlackRock managed $272 billion, or 6%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2023. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.
•Financial and Other Institutions BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $650 billion, or 13%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end 2023. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which the Company provides sub-advisory services, totaled $773 billion, or 16%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

(1)Amounts include AUM attributable to the Kreos Transaction.
Long-term product offerings include active and index strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index products include both our non-ETF index products and ETFs.
Although many clients use both active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.
Equity
Year-end 2023 equity AUM totaled $5.3 trillion, reflecting net outflows of $11 billion. Net outflows included $27 billion and $66 billion out of active and non-ETF index, respectively, partially offset by ETF net inflows of $81 billion.
BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international market strategies, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate.
Equity represented 58% of long-term AUM and 53% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023.
Fixed Income
Fixed income AUM ended 2023 at $2.8 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $143 billion. Net inflows included $112 billion and $32 billion into ETFs and non-ETF index, respectively, partially offset by $1 billion of net outflows from active. Fixed income ETF net inflows of $112 billion reflected the benefit of our diverse product offering and included strong flows into treasury, core and corporate credit ETFs.
Fixed income represented 30% of long-term AUM and 26% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023.
Multi-Asset
BlackRock manages a variety of multi-asset funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, and alternatives, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions may include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.
Multi-asset represented 9% of long-term AUM and 9% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023.

Multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $84 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients, including the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates. Defined contribution plans remained a significant driver of flows and contributed $30 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2023, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings.
The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:
•Target date and target risk strategies generated net inflows of $49 billion. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 81% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products.
•Asset allocation and balanced strategies generated $23 billion of net inflows. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flows in this category included pension outsourcing mandates that funded during the year. Flagship products also include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families.
•Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.
Alternatives
BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into three main categories - (1) illiquid alternatives, (2) liquid alternatives, and (3) currency and commodities. Illiquid alternatives include offerings in infrastructure, opportunistic and credit, private equity, real estate and alternative solutions. Liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds).
In 2023, liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined $2 billion of net inflows, or $10 billion excluding return of capital / return on investment of $8 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital / return on investment were opportunistic and credit strategies, infrastructure and private equity solutions. Net inflows were driven by infrastructure, opportunistic and credit strategies and private equity. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $32 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying. Currency and commodities saw $7 billion of net outflows, primarily from commodities ETFs.
BlackRock believes that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. BlackRock’s highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to continue to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.
Alternatives represented 3% of long-term AUM and 12% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023.
In the first quarter of 2024, BlackRock announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Global Infrastructure Management LLC (referred to herein as Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”)), a leading independent infrastructure manager with over $100 billion in client AUM as of September 30, 2023. GIP specializes in investing in, owning and operating assets across the energy, transport, digital infrastructure and water and waste management sectors. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, and wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, providing an end-to-end, SaaS solution for investment and risk management for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional and retail investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via Aladdin Risk, as well as investment accounting capabilities. Aladdin Provider is a tool used by asset servicers, connecting them to the platform used by asset managers and owners to add operational efficiency. In 2019, BlackRock acquired eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider to enable clients to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. eFront is offered to clients both as a standalone offering and as part of an integrated “Whole Portfolio View” solution that provides transparency across clients’ public and private assets. Through our Cachematrix platform, BlackRock is also a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform.
BlackRock offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering personalized digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities.
At year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Australia.
Technology services revenue of $1.5 billion was up 9% year-over-year, and annual contract value (“ACV”) increased 10% year-over-year. ACV growth was driven by strong net sales of Aladdin in 2023, with over half of new client mandates spanning multiple Aladdin products. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue. At the end of any period, BlackRock generally has recurring revenue contracts in place for a large portion of total annual revenue. BlackRock measures the fees related to these agreements and refers to this as ACV. For further information on ACV, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions across public and private markets. Approximately 25% of Aladdin’s revenue was denominated in non-US currencies. In addition, while Aladdin is a multi-asset system, the majority of positions managed on the platform are fixed income. 2023 technology services revenue growth reflected headwinds associated with 2022 bond market declines on Aladdin’s fixed income platform assets.
BlackRock is focused on enhancing Aladdin, with continued investment into areas such as whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and sustainable investing solutions. BlackRock continues to evolve and enable clients to further simplify their operating infrastructure with Aladdin. Clients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to meet their specific needs, and BlackRock is providing them with choice and flexibility. BlackRock is empowering clients with data and opening Aladdin by creating connectivity with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions, which include asset servicers, cloud providers, digital asset platforms, trading systems and others. This connectivity helps clients work in their Aladdin environments with a more customized and seamless end-to-end experience.
In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in financial technology and digital distribution providers, data and whole portfolio capabilities including Upvest, Avaloq, Human Interest, Circle, SpiderRock Advisors, Clarity AI, Envestnet, Acorns, Scalable Capital and iCapital. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense).
Securities Lending
Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash received as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.
Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $359 billion, up from $355 billion at year-end 2022. More demand for general collateral securities resulted in slightly higher balances year over year. Intrinsic lending spreads increased and cash reinvestment spreads remained flat as cash yields were stable year over year.
BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity, and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.
Risk and Quantitative Analysis
Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk and Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.
COMPETITION
BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms, financial technology providers and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.
HUMAN CAPITAL
With approximately 19,800 employees in more than 30 countries, as of December 31, 2023, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. As an asset manager, BlackRock’s long-term success depends on its people and how it manages its workforce.
Culture and Principles
BlackRock believes that maintaining a strong corporate culture is an important component of its human capital management practices and critical to the firm’s long-term success. BlackRock’s culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify its workforce and guide how it interacts with its employees, its clients, the communities in which it operates and its other stakeholders: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock; (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)
BlackRock believes a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture is a commercial imperative and indispensable to its success. Ultimately, a dynamic, inclusive organization allows BlackRock to attract and retain top talent around the world and to stay ahead of its clients’ needs.
BlackRock’s three pillar DEI strategy is aligned with the firm’s business priorities and long-term objectives. The three pillars are (1) talent and culture across the globe, which focuses on attracting, developing and retaining top talent by cultivating an inclusive work environment where employees have fair access to opportunities and feel seen, heard, valued and respected, (2) activities to support interested clients, which focus on expanding investment choices and business partnership opportunities with brokers, managers, and suppliers, and (3) impact in underserved communities, which focuses on helping more and more people experience financial well-being through BlackRock philanthropy and employee-led volunteer efforts.
BlackRock views transparency and measurement as critical to its strategy. Since 2020, the firm has published annual SASB-aligned disclosure and EEO-1 reports, and since 2022, a Global DEI Annual Report. As of January 1, 2024, of the Company’s employees who self-identified their gender status, approximately 44% of the Company's global workforce, 33% of global senior leaders (Directors or above) and 47% of global new hires, were women. Additionally, as of January 1, 2024, of the Company’s US employees who self-identified their race/ethnicity status, approximately 8% of employees, 4% of senior leaders and 10% of new hires identified as Black or African American, 8% of employees, 5% of senior leaders and 16% of new hires identified as Latinx, and 28% of employees, 21% of senior leaders and 30% of new hires identified as Asian. Further, of the Company's approximately 19,800 employees as of December 31, 2023, 46% were based in the Americas, 31% were based in EMEA and 23% were based in Asia-Pacific regions.
Board Oversight of Human Capital Management
BlackRock’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management and devotes one Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock’s culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, DEI strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee periodically reviews efforts and developments related to the firm’s human capital management strategy.
Succession planning for BlackRock’s Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives is a key part of the Board’s annual review of human capital management issues. As part of this review, the Board focuses on whether BlackRock has the right people in place to execute the Company’s long-term strategic plans, and on BlackRock’s ability to identify, attract, develop, promote and retain future senior executives. An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within.
Employee Engagement
BlackRock values continuous dialogue with its employees to better understand their experiences at the firm and assess the efficacy of its human capital management practices. The Company uses several employee engagement mechanisms, including: (1) employee opinion pulse surveys; (2) interactive events and communications; (3) the sponsorship of employee networks; and (4) local community involvement. The employee opinion pulse surveys, which BlackRock conducts throughout the year, provide the Company with actionable feedback for its teams and for the Company as a whole. Additionally, BlackRock uses ongoing lifecycle surveys to collect feedback at various points along the employee journey. BlackRock works to keep employees informed and engaged through a regular cadence of communications and events, including newsletters, global and local townhalls and messages from leaders with timely business and organizational updates and culture-building opportunities. BlackRock’s employee networks also provide additional forums and opportunities for employees with a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to connect with one another and enhance the firm’s culture. Open to all, the networks are designed by employees, for employees, are sponsored by senior leaders and strengthen the One BlackRock community.
BlackRock believes that employees value opportunities to give back to their communities. Through local, employee-led BlackRock Gives committees, the Company supports nonprofit organizations nominated by employees in the communities where it operates. In addition, the Company has a matching gifts program that provides full-time employees with up to $10,000 per year in matched donations to any IRS qualified charitable organization, Full-time employees are also given two paid volunteer days per year and BlackRock matches volunteer time with eligible charities.
Compensation, Wellness and Benefits
BlackRock is committed to responsible business practices and believes that investing in the physical, emotional, mental and financial well-being of its employees is a critical component of the firm’s human capital management strategy. To that end, the Company designs its compensation and benefits practices to: (1) attract, motivate, and retain talented employees; (2) align employee incentives and risk-taking with that of the firm and the interests of its clients; and (3) support employees and their families across many aspects of their lives. The Company has a strong pay-for-performance culture and an annual compensation process that takes into consideration firmwide results, individual business results and employee performance, as well as market benchmarks. BlackRock also offers a wide range of benefits that it regularly reviews in accordance with market practices and the local requirements of its offices, including, where applicable, retirement savings plans, a Flexible Time Off (“FTO”) policy and flexible working arrangements, parental leave and family forming benefits, such as fertility benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, and backup elder and childcare benefits. The Company provides comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, counseling services, an employee assistance program and access to telemedicine services, where available. The Company also offers a Mental Health Ambassador program that is comprised of global volunteers across office locations who are trained in empathetic listening skills and direct interested colleagues to benefits, tools and resources to support mental health.
BlackRock prioritizes protecting the rights of its workforce. The Company has implemented policies related to harassment prevention and compliance with equal employment opportunity and overtime regulations. BlackRock is also committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for its workforce. To do this, it designs global programs, including environmental and occupational health and safety programs, to meet or exceed local requirements. Moreover, BlackRock encourages all of its employees to raise issues of concern and assures employees that they may do so without fear of retaliation.
Recruiting, Training and Development
BlackRock recognizes that, like all companies, it is operating in an increasingly competitive environment. As such, the Company engages in efforts to reach top talent, including continued partnerships with organizations that promote talent from many different backgrounds; regularly reviewing job postings for potentially biased language; and actively engaging in outreach and recruitment efforts for its open positions. In the spirit of attracting talent from broad backgrounds, BlackRock also provides formal recruiting programs for Veterans (former service members transitioning to civilian careers) and Returners (individuals who have taken a career break of 18 months or more).
BlackRock is also committed to innovation, learning and reinvention in all areas of its business and believes that developing the capabilities of its employees is integral to delivering long-term value. To that end, the Company’s human capital management practices are designed to provide opportunities for employees to learn, innovate and enhance their skillsets at every stage of their career. One example is the BlackRock Academies, the firm’s online suite of interactive resources and courses, which enable employees to build skills in specific facets of BlackRock’s business and purpose. The Company believes these opportunities play an important role in engaging BlackRock’s employees.
In addition, BlackRock believes that a critical driver of its future success is its ability to grow strong leaders and people managers. The Company invests in leadership development programs designed to foster career growth. For leadership development, BlackRock provides training and makes coaching available to people managers to assist in building foundational skills.
REGULATION
Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.
BlackRock’s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, securities, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.
GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM
Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) and International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Most recently, such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities of money market funds (“MMFs”), open-ended funds (“OEFs”) and sustainability regulations.
Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers
Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened since the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by the Liquidity Driven Investment events in the UK. This has prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). In November 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to rules governing OEF liquidity risk management and swing pricing. The European Union (“EU”) also proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs (including MMFs), enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and allow such regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. Meanwhile, the UK proposed introducing liquidity facilities to certain asset owners, which could result in regulatory burdens on asset managers. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require changes to structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.
Global MMF Reforms
Following the market events of March 2020, US, UK and EU authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of MMFs in market downturns. In the US, the SEC adopted changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 governing MMFs, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of such funds, and requiring mandatory liquidity fees under certain circumstances. The UK released a consultation in December 2023 indicating their intent to change regulatory requirements for MMFs domiciled or marketed in the UK, including material increases in required liquidity levels. Although EU authorities stated in July 2023 that they would not re-open the EU regulatory framework for MMFs in the near term, the UK’s proposed changes may increase pressure to implement similar reforms as the vast majority of MMFs sold in the UK are EU-domiciled and regulated. Such regulatory reforms could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock’s MMF products.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) and Sustainability
ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. The International Sustainability Standards Board (“ISSB”) released its first two disclosure standards in 2023, which may inform national regulators’ approaches. For example, the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia have already indicated their intention to endorse these standards. In the US, the SEC has proposed a series of rules that would require, among other things: (1) corporate issuers to make substantial climate-related disclosures in periodic reports, including with respect to governance, risk management, business strategy, financial statement metrics and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and (2) enhanced ESG disclosures by investment companies and investment advisers in fund and adviser filings, including disclosures on ESG strategies and how ESG factors are considered, and GHG emissions disclosure by certain environmentally focused funds. Furthermore, the SEC has announced plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers’ and funds’ ESG strategies, policies and procedures. In addition, the US Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued final rules clarifying that Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) plan fiduciaries can, but are not required to, consider the economic effects of ESG factors for purposes of investing ERISA plan assets and exercising voting rights with respect to plan investments. Moreover, California passed several laws in 2023 that will require companies doing business in California to make certain types of climate-related disclosures, and other states may adopt similar laws.
The EU has enacted numerous regulations on ESG and sustainability, including on sustainability-related disclosures by financial market participants; integration of sustainability considerations into investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; making the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences; and requiring asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities and make detailed disclosures relating to ESG characteristics of funds and portfolios. Further regulations include the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which will require enhanced sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers, with phased implementation beginning in 2024 and for a wider group of global companies from 2028. In December 2023, the EU reached provisional agreement on a directive, which if adopted in its current form, would require a wide group of European and global companies to provide transition plans and conduct due diligence on the sustainability of their suppliers. The EU and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) are also developing rules and guidelines for the use of ESG or sustainability related terms in fund names, focused on specifying a minimum threshold of assets meeting ESG or sustainable criteria for such funds.
Within the UK, the FCA has proposed UK-specific sustainability regulations, including a sustainable product classification system for funds and enhanced disclosure requirements, which are expected to apply on a staggered basis from July 2024. In addition, His Majesty's Treasury (“HMT”) released a consultation to bring ESG rating providers under regulation by the FCA and will consult on a UK-specific taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities.
A number of Asia-Pacific jurisdictions are consulting on sustainability reporting obligations aligned with the ISSB standards. Similarly, policymakers in Japan have announced that they are preparing a local version of the ISSB standards. Japan and Singapore have published codes of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers, with Hong Kong considering a similar approach, while India introduced a regulatory framework for ESG ratings providers in July 2023.
Taxation
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. Legislation at both the US federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission (“EC”) has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15% (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” Framework). EU member states adopted, or plan to adopt, laws implementing the OECD’s minimum tax rules under the Pillar Two Framework, which are expected to go into effect in 2024. Several other countries, including the UK, have changed or are considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD’s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which BlackRock does business have and may continue to change, and any such changes could increase its tax liabilities. The Company is continuing to monitor legislative developments and evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two Framework on future periods.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed have required or will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements.
In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to central clearing and trading venue execution requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU and UK, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. Further, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, are subject to requirements in the US, EU, UK and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements also apply in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, in certain cases produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules, and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks.
US REGULATORY REFORM
Antitrust Rules and Guidance
In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking with amendments to rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties in certain transactions to provide the FTC and DOJ prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would significantly expand the information required to be reported and documentation to be submitted in connection with an HSR filing. If enacted as drafted, the proposed rules could substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification expenses and delay transactions. In December 2023 the FTC and DOJ also jointly issued new merger guidelines, which could impact the ability of the Company to expand its services through strategic investments or acquisitions.
Designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”)
The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the US under the Dodd-Frank Act. In November 2023, the FSOC finalized amendments to its existing interpretive guidance to remove the prioritization of an activities-based approach over an entity-specific approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks to financial stability, although the amendment clarified that the FSOC retained the ability to use an activities-based approach when appropriate. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory and capital requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.
US DOL Fiduciary Rule
In October 2023, the US DOL proposed a new regulation redefining the meaning of “investment advice fiduciary” under ERISA as well as amendments to several prohibited transaction exemptions applicable to investment advice fiduciaries. If adopted as proposed, the rule would substantially expand when a person would be considered a fiduciary subject to ERISA and could require BlackRock to revise a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock and its distribution partners, and limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain services to applicable clients.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
The SEC, Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, any such limitations or restrictions could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.
In October 2020, the SEC adopted regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (“RICs”), including mutual funds (other than MMFs), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. RICs were required to implement and comply with this rule beginning in 2022. The rule, among other things, imposes limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a RIC can enter into, eliminates the asset segregation compliance framework and introduces new compliance requirements for funds, including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs. The rule may impact certain RICs’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy.
In 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (“SBS”) transactions to require public reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts.
SEC Proposed Rules on Private Fund Advisers
In 2023, the SEC adopted new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These included amendments to Form PF for registered investment advisers requiring new disclosures, filing obligations and enhanced reporting. The SEC adopted additional rules requiring registered private fund advisers to, among other things, provide quarterly reports to fund investors, obtain annual audits for funds, distribute fairness opinions in connection with certain transactions, prohibit certain types of preferential terms and treatment, and provide transparency to investors of all types of preferential treatment granted to other investors in the same fund. Implementing these rules and amendments may significantly increase BlackRock’s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock’s alternatives products.
Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS
In 2023, the SEC re-proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of “exchange” and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules may increase compliance costs for BlackRock.
SEC US Treasury Clearing Mandate
In December 2023, the SEC adopted rules mandating central clearing of US Treasury repurchases and certain other Treasury transactions. The rules require many market participants, including a large number of BlackRock funds and accounts, to clear Treasury repurchase transactions and potentially certain cash Treasury securities transactions through a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which could increase transaction costs for BlackRock’s clients.
Proposed Rules on Equity Market Structure
In 2023, the SEC proposed equity market structure reforms that would significantly change how national market system (“NMS”) stock orders are priced, executed and reported. The reforms include: (1) a requirement for certain retail orders to be subject to order-by-order competition, (2) an SEC-level best execution rule and (3) an adjustment to the tick sizes at which NMS stocks can be quoted or traded. If enacted as proposed, the collective impact of the rules may adversely affect market efficiency and execution costs, which would result in negative effects for BlackRock’s business and clients.
SEC Rules on Short Sales and Reporting of Securities Loans
In 2023, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring certain institutional managers to report short positions and activity to the SEC for publication on an aggregate basis, which could potentially impact investment strategies and result in greater operational burdens and cost for BlackRock. The SEC also adopted a new rule requiring certain persons to report information on securities loan transactions to a registered national securities association which will then publish certain information. The rule may increase BlackRock’s operational burdens and costs.
SEC Standard Settlement Rules
In 2023, the SEC adopted amendments and new rules which, among other things, shortened the standard settlement for most securities transactions to one business day after the trade date (T+1), which will likely increase BlackRock’s operational burdens and costs.
SEC Predictive Data Analytics Rules
The SEC proposed new rules in 2023 that would require broker-dealers and investment advisers, when engaging or communicating with investors using predictive data analytics (“PDA”) and PDA-like technologies, to evaluate such technologies for conflicts of interest and, where identified, eliminate or neutralize the conflict of interest. If adopted as proposed, the rules could encompass a wide range of forward-looking uses of technology applications and impose significant operational burdens and costs.
SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers
The SEC has recently engaged in various initiatives and reviews impacting regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. For example, the SEC adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports, adopted final amendments to the rule governing fund names, expanding the scope of the rule to fund names including growth, value, ESG or similar terms, and proposed rules governing outsourcing of certain functions by investment advisers to service providers.
INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORM
Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms
The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, will become applicable beginning in January 2025. DORA will, among other things: (1) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) potentially subject Aladdin to additional oversight. In parallel with DORA, the UK proposed a new Critical Third Party regime to regulate certain third parties designated by HMT as “critical” to the financial sector, and UK regulators have issued a consultation on proposed requirements for “critical” third parties, with further consultations expected in 2024.
Retail Investment Strategy
In 2023, the European Commission (“EC”) adopted a Retail Investment Strategy package with wide-reaching amendments intended to enhance protections for retail investors. If enacted as proposed, these changes may impact BlackRock’s operations in European markets, including product development, client servicing and distribution models.
FSMA 2023
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (“FSMA 2023”) reflects significant changes to the UK framework for financial services regulation, including changes that: (1) revoke retained EU law related to financial services regulation, (2) amend the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation frameworks, (3) establish a new designated activities regime and (4) reform the financial promotion regime for unauthorized firms. The UK government and FCA are expected to publish further legislation setting out specific changes impacting the UK market in 2024.
Mansion House Reforms
The Mansion House reforms announced in July 2023 also build on the new UK regulatory framework enabled by the FSMA 2023. Potential impacts to the asset management sector include: (1) repeal and replacement of the packaged retail and insurance based investment products (""PRIIPs"") Regulation; (2) review of the UK’s green finance strategy, including potential regulation of ESG data providers; (3) review of governance through the Senior Managers and Certification Regime; (4) repeal of EU legislation on the European Long-Term Investment Fund; (5) market infrastructure reforms; (6) reassessment of the boundary between investment advice and financial guidance; and (7) independent review of the UK investment research landscape.
Overseas Fund Regime (“OFR”)
OFR, the simplified regime through which non-UK funds can register with the FCA to be marketed to UK retail investors, was enacted in February 2022 and is expected to be implemented through 2024. OFR requires consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled to be found equivalent to the UK’s regime in order to market such funds in the UK.
Conduct Regulation
The FCA continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the implementation of the Consumer Duty by all asset management firms, including BlackRock’s UK subsidiaries. The Consumer Duty rules require firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers in their manufacture and distribution of products and services, in respect of price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. Any failure to meet the FCA’s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk.
UK Stewardship Code Review
The UK Financial Reporting Council has announced a planned review of the UK Stewardship Code in 2024 to consider potential revisions to address stakeholder concerns.
Reform of Investment Markets
BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company’s provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The Regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms were substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. Forthcoming proposals to review the operation of MiFID II and to develop a new EU Retail Investment Strategy may affect the European market structure and impact BlackRock’s ability to operate in European markets. The broad nature of MiFID II means future reforms could also affect product development, client servicing and distribution models. Similar reforms have been implemented in Switzerland and Australia.
Regulatory Environment in China
The Company’s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company’s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on transfers of certain types of onshore data of the Company’s Chinese entities to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock’s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock’s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance.
EXISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DOL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the FTC, the Department of Justice, the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies.
Certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as certain BlackRock subsidiaries, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through attorneys general, insurance commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities.
The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as certain BlackRock subsidiaries and affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act requires one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”). BTC's registration as a municipal advisor subjects BTC to additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.
BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, real estate funds, collective trust funds, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rulemaking or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area.
Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA.
BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. In addition, two of BlackRock’s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also a member of the MSRB and is subject to MSRB rules.
BlackRock’s business activity in California that involves the processing of personal information is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which provide for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA and CPRA impose obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. In addition, several other US states have proposed or adopted similar privacy laws. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA, CPRA or similar state privacy laws may result in fines, heightened regulatory scrutiny, litigation and/or reputational harm.
US Banking Regulation
One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC’s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders.
EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION - OVERVIEW
BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.
Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.
Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.
European Regulation
The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branch of one of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital and liquidity resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business requirements, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.
In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established, including the branches of the Netherlands entity which operate across the EU.
BlackRock’s EU subsidiaries and branches must comply with the EU regulatory regime set out in MiFID II. BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries must comply with the UK version of MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities in the UK. MiFID II, and the UK equivalent of MiFID II, set out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. The legislation also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock UK subsidiaries must also comply with the UK regulation which implements the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for certain investment firms arising out of the IFPR. These include requirements to ensure capital adequacy, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, as implemented in the relevant EU Member States and in the UK, which impose obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of retail and alternative investment funds respectively that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will affect certain of BlackRock’s European operations. Compliance with the UCITS Directives and the AIFMD may subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements. BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (""EMIR"") (or the UK version of EMIR transposed into UK law in accordance with The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in the case of BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (1) the central clearing of certain OTC derivatives; (2) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties); and (3) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an ESMA registered or recognized derivatives trade repository (or a UK authorized trade repository in the case of the UK version of EMIR).
The EU has seen an increase in Common Supervisory Actions by ESMA to coordinate supervisory action by national EU regulators, most notably in areas such as product governance, liquidity management and fund costs and charges. BlackRock’s EU operations may be affected to the extent this initiative results in formal legislation or action.
EU Member States, the UK and many other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of personal data security breaches if certain thresholds are met. For example, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in 2018, and the UK transposed the GDPR into national law (“UK GDPR”), which became effective in 2021. In June 2021, the EC published a new set of standard contractual clauses, which only apply to the transfer of personal data outside of the EU to a country not approved by the EU as providing an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data. The EU's adequacy decision with respect to the UK, which allows the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, will be regularly reviewed and may be revoked if the UK diverges from its current adequate data protection laws. The UK has developed its own international data transfer agreement, which was implemented in March 2022. In June 2023, the EU-US Data Protection Framework came into force, which allows organizations to self-certify their compliance under the framework for data transfers from the EU, UK and Switzerland to the US. GDPR and UK GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock’s collection, processing, retention and transfer of personal data and reporting of personal data security breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.
BlackRock also maintains two offices in the Middle East, one in Dubai, which is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority, and one in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is regulated by the Saudi Capital Markets Authority. Both offices are authorized to provide certain investment services and support BlackRock’s provision of investment products and services in their countries of domicile. Other countries across the Middle Eastern region are serviced on a cross-border basis.
Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region
In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (“FIEA”) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEA. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act.
In Australia, BlackRock’s operating entity is principally regulated under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”), which includes holding an Australian financial services license and operating registered managed investment schemes. ASIC is Australia’s integrated corporate, markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator.
In New Zealand, certain BlackRock subsidiaries are primarily regulated by the Financial Markets Authority (“FMA”). The FMA is responsible for overseeing and enforcing financial markets legislation including the licensing of firms to provide certain financial products and services in New Zealand and administering anti-money laundering and terrorism financing legislation, amongst other functions.
The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC.
BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector.
BlackRock’s Fund Management Company in China (“BlackRock FMC”) is regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and is subject to the Securities Investment Fund Law and Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Mutual Fund Managers for the overall oversight from incorporation to the corporate governance and operations of fund managers and funds. BlackRock FMC is also subject to the China Securities Law and various other financial laws and regulations. BlackRock CCB Wealth Management Limited, which is BlackRock’s wealth management joint venture company with CCB Wealth Management Co., Ltd. and Fullerton Management Pte Ltd. in China, is regulated by the National Financial Regulatory Administration (“NFRA”, formerly known as the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission). They have enacted Bank Wealth Management Supervision and Management Measures and Management Measures of Bank Wealth Management Subsidiaries and other relevant rules to regulate the setup, conduct of business and risk management of bank wealth management companies.
In Singapore, a BlackRock subsidiary is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) and its business activities are subject to the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (“SFA”). The SFA governs the regulation of activities and institutions in the securities and derivatives industry, including fund management, dealing in capital markets products and leveraged foreign exchange trading. The MAS is Singapore’s central bank and integrated financial regulator, which regulates the financial services sector in Singapore and conducts integrated supervision of financial services and financial stability surveillance. This BlackRock subsidiary and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFA are required to be licensed with the MAS, and are subject to the SFA and the regulations, rules, codes, notices and guidelines issued by the MAS.
Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.

As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, reputational, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.
MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS
Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or movements in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of its clients, as well as the impact of global fiscal, monetary and trade policies, could cause:
•the value of AUM, or BlackRock's returns on AUM, to decrease;
•client redemptions from BlackRock’s products;
•client rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;
•an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.
These risks may also be heightened by market volatility, illiquid market conditions or other market disruptions. The occurrence of any of the above events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock’s AUM and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s net income and operating cash flows.
In recent years, global markets have experienced substantial volatility, with significant downturns in both bond and equity markets. In addition, central banks worldwide have raised interest rates in an effort to moderate rising inflation. BlackRock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Similarly, due to the global nature of BlackRock’s operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the United States (""US"") dollar. BlackRock’s exposure to foreign exchange rates relative to the US dollar and interest rates may cause BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s base fees, net income and operating cash flows.
In addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees.
BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds, or to remove BlackRock as a fund’s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors). In addition, shareholder activism involving closed-end funds has increased, including public campaigns to demand that a fund consider significant transactions such as a tender offer, merger or liquidation or seek other actions such as the termination of the fund's management contract. If a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on similar terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance.
Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such BlackRock products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The investment management industry is highly competitive, and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, liquidity, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, over the past several years, there has been continued consolidation in the asset management industry as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multi-asset investment capabilities and technological expertise, including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs. This consolidation, together with the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with the products, services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock’s competitive success. Aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand toward standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform offerings or flexibility, or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, to the extent that Aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than BlackRock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, BlackRock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property (“IP”), there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its IP rights in Aladdin.
BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk.
BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of increasingly customizable products, requires continued innovative effort on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services, constraints on BlackRock’s ability to manage growth within client mandates, compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements and IP-related lawsuits or claims, which may not be fully evident or identified at such time. A growing number of BlackRock’s products and services also depend on data provided by third parties as analytical inputs and are subject to additional risks, including with respect to data quality, cost, availability and provider relationships. Data sets for certain developing analytics, such as those in the sustainability space, continue to evolve and difficulties approximating gaps in the data, sourcing data from reliable sources, or validating the data could adversely impact the accuracy and effectiveness of such analytics. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timeline they require. Any failure to successfully develop new products and services, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm BlackRock’s reputation and expose the Company to additional costs, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns as well as BlackRock’s minority investments could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.
At December 31, 2023, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $3.8 billion in its investments (see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as certain minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline.
BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.
BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan which mitigates the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2023 and subject to this type of indemnification was approximately $259 billion. In the Company’s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling approximately $276 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2023. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s decision on whether to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to seed, warehouse or otherwise support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Any decision by BlackRock on whether to support products may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. BlackRock’s ability to seed, warehouse or otherwise support certain products may be restricted by regulation or by the Company’s failure to have or make available sufficient capital or liquidity. Moreover, inherent constraints arising from the business models of certain asset managers, including BlackRock, may during periods of market volatility result in BlackRock having fewer options for accessing liquidity than asset managers with alternate business models, which may adversely impact its ability to support certain products. Any decision by BlackRock to support particular products, or its inability or unwillingness to provide such support, may result in losses or affect BlackRock's capital or liquidity, which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock’s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, terrorist activity or acts of civil or international hostility, could have an adverse impact on BlackRock. For instance, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas wars and potential escalation have and may continue to result in geopolitical instability and adversely affect the global economy, supply chains, specific markets and operations. Strategic competition between the US and China and resulting tensions and heightened levels of political polarization have also contributed to uncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory landscapes. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock’s control, including natural disasters, climate-related events, pandemics or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension or impact the US or global economy in ways that are uncertain. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company’s products, operations, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackRock currently operates or seeks to expand its presence.
Climate-related risks could adversely affect BlackRock’s business, products, operations and clients, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s business and those of its clients could be impacted by climate-related risks. Climate-related risks may impact BlackRock through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Climate-related physical risks arise from the direct impacts of a changing climate in the short- and long-term. Such risks may include the risks of extreme weather events and changes in temperature, which may damage infrastructure and facilities, including BlackRock’s physical assets, as well as disrupt connectivity or supply chains. Climate-related transition risks arise from exposure to the transition to a low-carbon economy through policy, regulatory, technology and market changes. For instance, new or divergent climate regulations or guidance, as well as differing perspectives of stakeholders regarding climate impacts, have affected and may continue to affect BlackRock’s business activities and reputation, increase scrutiny and complicate compliance requirements, which could increase the Company’s costs.
Climate-related physical and transition risks could also impact BlackRock’s business both directly and indirectly through adverse impacts to its clients’ investments, including as a result of declines in asset values, changes in client preferences, increased regulatory and compliance costs and significant business disruptions. Any of these risks may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE
Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:
•client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors;
•client shifts to products that charge lower fees;
•the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;
•reduced, minimal or no performance fees;
•an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital.
Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.
A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $554 million, or 3%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company’s performance fee generating assets. In particular, the Company expects that as it manages more illiquid products, its performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products.
Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.
BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors or limitations in the underlying models, model inputs or assumptions, including those from third-party sources, as well as any failure of BlackRock’s governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models, model inputs or assumptions, the failure to timely update such models, model inputs or assumptions or errors in how such models are used, could have adverse effects on BlackRock’s business and reputation. These risks may be heightened by the rapid growth and complexity of new models, evolving data sets and standards and market volatility.
TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS
A failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock’s operations, systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the Company’s reputation and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations is concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London, Edinburgh, Budapest, Atlanta, Gurgaon and Belgrade. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic, health crisis or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt BlackRock’s operations in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in business disruption or impede the Company's growth.
Despite BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations or contractual obligations leading to reputational harm, legal liability, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.
A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them, including data provided by third parties that is significant to portions of BlackRock's business and products. An information security incident or disruption, such as a cyber-attack including social engineering, a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, denial-of-service or ransomware attack, or a failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, developments in BlackRock’s use of process automation and artificial intelligence (“AI”), as well as the use of remote access by employees and mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock’s control. BlackRock’s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information or third-party data. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies including quantum computing increase the speed and computing power available.
The financial services industry has been the subject of cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors, terrorist organizations, cyber criminals and hacktivists. BlackRock has been and continues to be the target of cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and continues to monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and cause financial losses. Advances in technology, including generative AI, and use of such technology by malicious actors could heighten these risks. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures proves fully effective. In addition, given the evolving nature of cyber threat actors and the increasing sophistication of cyber-attack methodology, a successful cyber-attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and it may take a considerable amount of time for an investigation to be completed and the severity and potential impact to be known. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock’s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock’s systems.
In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock or any such third party may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock or such third parties may not have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.
Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information or failure to disclose or communicate a cybersecurity incident appropriately, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, BlackRock’s cybersecurity insurance may not cover all losses and damages from such events and BlackRock’s ability to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future may be limited.
Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.
BlackRock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. In so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers, including for cloud hosting and technologies supporting cloud-based operations. For example, Aladdin’s data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to Aladdin’s growth. In addition, the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin’s analytical calculations. Although BlackRock has implemented internal controls and procedures and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the Aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. Any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with Aladdin’s size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise Aladdin’s resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients.
Continuing enhancements to Aladdin’s capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.
The operation of BlackRock’s Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, configuration change management, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. These updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin’s processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose BlackRock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, increased costs, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
In addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions. In addition, there has been increased regulatory scrutiny globally on technology and information providers, which may impact Aladdin and certain functionalities and tools.
A failure to effectively manage the development and use of AI, combined with an evolving regulatory environment, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s growth, reputation or business.
BlackRock uses machine learning and AI in its business and expects to continue to expand its AI capabilities, including through generative AI. AI methods are complex and rapidly evolving, and the introduction of AI into new or existing processes may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, IP or other litigation, data protection, confidentiality or information security risks, social or ethical concerns, competitive harm or other complications. For example, the use of datasets to develop and test AI models, the content generated by AI systems, or the application of AI systems may be found to be insufficient, biased or harmful, or lead to adverse business decisions or operating errors. AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed. In addition, IP ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies have not been fully addressed by US courts or federal, state or non-US laws or regulation. Furthermore, regulation of AI technologies is evolving globally. Efforts around use of these technologies require additional investment in operational controls and procedures, development and implementation of appropriate protections and safeguards for handling the use of data with AI, including with respect to data leakage, and regulatory compliance costs. Any failure to successfully integrate AI technologies, respond to client or market demands or effectively manage the related risks could harm BlackRock’s growth and reputation, adversely impact product offerings, client interactions or business initiatives, and expose the Company to legal and regulatory liabilities and additional costs, including regulatory fines or sanctions, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.
BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. In addition, while BlackRock, Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements, certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards, which require them to maintain certain levels of capital and liquidity. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.
Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses.
BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from any losses related to the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks.
Inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.
BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, deliver whole-portfolio solutions, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures, entering into strategic joint ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses, analytics, models and other IP. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases, the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions, and such transactions may be the subject of unanticipated liabilities arising from commercial disputes, information security vulnerabilities or breaches and IP or other legal claims. The success of BlackRock’s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy in the timeframe BlackRock expects, or at all. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock’s inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products, business lines or early stage investments or are delivered via technology and systems that differ from those employed by BlackRock or that overlap with existing BlackRock businesses. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock’s control, as well as risks related to the jurisdictions or markets in which such investees or joint ventures operate. For example, BlackRock has a minority investment in Circle Internet Financial (“Circle”), which is associated with crypto asset markets which experienced substantial volatility and high-profile enterprise failures and bankruptcies. The crypto asset markets are subject to significant regulatory uncertainty, which could also negatively impact BlackRock’s investment in Circle. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, governance or oversight rights, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could result in losses or impairments related to such transactions and have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry.
BlackRock is subject to risks associated with its proposed acquisition of GIP, including completion of the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe and failure to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisition.
BlackRock is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with its proposed acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”), including the risk that a condition to closing may not be satisfied or waived, the possibility of failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, which may be outside of BlackRock’s or GIP’s control, or the possibility that the acquisition does not close in the anticipated timeframe or at all. BlackRock may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including synergies, value creation or other benefits of the proposed acquisition fully or at all, or on the timeline BlackRock expects. At times, the resources of either or both companies or the attention of certain members of their management may be focused on completion of the acquisition and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company’s ongoing business. In addition, consummation of the acquisition may have an adverse impact on the Company, including from risks related to significant transaction costs, unknown liabilities, litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the acquisition or if the acquired business does not perform as expected, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock's alternatives products include investments in early-stage companies, private equity portfolio companies and real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, which may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.
BlackRock’s alternatives products include investments in early-stage companies, private equity portfolio companies and real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, which may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such investments and portfolio companies. These may include:
•risks related to the potential illiquidity, valuation and disposition of such investments;
•risks related to emerging and less established companies that have, among other things, short operating histories, new technologies and products, nascent control functions, quickly evolving markets and limited financial resources;
•construction risks, including as a result of force majeure, labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;
•accidents, pandemics, health crises or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control;
•climate-related risks, including greater frequency or intensity of adverse weather and natural disasters;
•personal injury or property damage;
•failures on the part of third-party servicers and operators, including managers and contractors, appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;
•risks related to investments in emerging markets, including economic and political risks and differences in legal or regulatory environments, which may make enforcement of legal obligations more difficult;
•exposure to stringent and complex non-US, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;
•environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;
•changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;
•risks related to the availability, cost, coverage and other limitations on insurance;
•risks related to governance and oversight, including board oversight, of portfolio companies;
•the financial resources of tenants; and
•contingent liabilities on disposition of investments.
The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanctions or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests and those changes may make such developments or projects less attractive than at the time they were commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock’s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management’s attention away from BlackRock’s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks.
As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Operating outside the US may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. Similarly, certain jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates may not have comparable levels of protection for corporate assets, such as IP, and client information and records, to the US. As a result, there may also be heightened information security or privacy risks in those jurisdictions. Any theft or unauthorized use of data, technology or IP may negatively impact BlackRock’s business operations and reputation. In addition, changes to the political or regulatory environment in a jurisdiction in which BlackRock operates, including increased restrictions or scrutiny, may adversely impact BlackRock’s business or operating activities. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions and impede the Company's growth, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL
The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Many of BlackRock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock’s operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or timely report issues, or errors in judgment. Such risks may be exacerbated in times of increased market volatility, high trading volumes or workforce turnover. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management framework and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks. Notwithstanding these measures, BlackRock cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks and BlackRock employees have in the past engaged in improper conduct. In addition, BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may in the future deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. This risk may be heightened as BlackRock expands into new markets and increases the breadth of its business offerings, all of which introduce additional complexity to its risk management program. The changing nature of the office environment, such as return to office arrangements and remote and alternative work models, could cause employees to become disconnected with corporate culture and policies, which may increase operational issues. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, cause adverse publicity, and result in litigation, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure to recruit, train and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is highly competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified and diverse employees include the Company’s reputation and workplace culture, the immigration and public health policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, its approach to remote and alternative work models, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.
In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to certain of its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, decreases in BlackRock’s share price could impair the retention value of such deferred compensation. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract, develop and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.
RISKS RELATED TO KEY THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS
The impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that BlackRock manages, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose BlackRock’s clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. Counterparties may also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk management systems or expose BlackRock and/or its clients to losses resulting from employee malfeasance, negligence or human error. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackRock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple BlackRock clients. Any such operational issue, impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products that BlackRock manages for its clients, which may lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
The failure of key third-party providers to BlackRock to fulfill their obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock depends on a number of key third-party providers for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) data, market indices, insurance, technology and AI, cloud hosting and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. Further, BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients’ investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock’s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. While BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. In addition, BlackRock’s operations and processes rely on commercially available data provided by third parties as well as providers of services, including technology services, and operating errors, process delays and failures or failures to comply with data usage requirements with respect to these service providers may adversely impact BlackRock. Data providers commonly disclaim the accuracy and completeness of data and BlackRock does not have the ability to validate or verify the accuracy and completeness of commercially sourced datasets. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock’s arrangement with a vendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.
BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one third-party provider to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key third-party provider to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management or other agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational, legal and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company’s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock.
Key technology partnerships may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory oversight, as well as migration, execution, technology and operational risks.
In April 2020, BlackRock announced a strategic partnership to host Aladdin infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure cloud and commenced a multi-year plan to migrate the Aladdin environments for BlackRock and its external Aladdin clients to the cloud. In addition, BlackRock has also migrated certain systems that support its corporate functions to cloud-based platforms. The benefits of cloud-based platforms are significant and BlackRock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its migration strategies; however these partnerships also introduce new risks, including: (1) risks associated with relying on third-parties for aspects of infrastructure reliability and stability; (2) software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology; (3) operational and execution risks, including those related to migration; and (4) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations, which risks may be further exacerbated as BlackRock and the Aladdin platform continue to grow. Failures by BlackRock to manage these risks, and/or risks associated with future potential technology partnerships, may result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.
BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value (“NAV”). The NAV of an ETF is calculated at least once daily, generally at the end of each business day, and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF’s holdings. The trading price of the ETF’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. The creation/redemption feature and arbitrage mechanism of an ETF are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the NAV. Notwithstanding these features, exchange prices have in the past deviated measurably from the NAV of certain ETFs and may under certain circumstances do so in the future. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, and the inability or unwillingness of market makers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively. These risks may be heightened as a result of significant market volatility, the growth of the ETF industry combined with increased market activity, as well as the complexity associated with certain products or asset classes. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate meaningfully from an ETF’s NAV, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS
BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world, which increases its cost of doing business.
BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex.
In addition, many of BlackRock’s legal entities are subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives, the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017, the UK Bribery Act, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations and the EU and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which BlackRock operates, such as His Majesty’s Treasury’s (“HMT”) Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation.
BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the GDPR and UK GDPR, which impose stringent data protection rules for individuals within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and UK, respectively, and for personal data exported outside the EEA and UK.
BlackRock is additionally subject to scrutiny from various government agencies that focus on antitrust and competition laws and regulations within the US and internationally, including in connection with merger control proceedings and proposed investments. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company’s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted.
BlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BTC’s bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see Item 1, Business - Regulation.
New regulations informed by global standard setters and/or developed by various national authorities may expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) and International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Such workstreams have focused on areas such as money market funds (“MMFs”), open-ended funds (“OEFs”) and sustainability regulations. BlackRock is, and may become, subject to increasing regulation in these areas, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, including:
•Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers: Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened since the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by the Liquidity Driven Investment events in the UK. This has prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). In November 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to rules governing OEF liquidity risk management and swing pricing. The EU also proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs (including MMFs), enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and allow such regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. Meanwhile, the UK proposed introducing liquidity facilities to certain asset owners, which could result in regulatory burdens on asset managers. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require changes to structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.
•Global MMF Reforms: Following the market events of March 2020, US, UK and EU authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of MMFs in market downturns. In the US, the SEC adopted changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 governing MMFs, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of such funds, and requiring mandatory liquidity fees under certain circumstances. The UK released a consultation in December 2023 indicating their intent to change regulatory requirements for MMFs domiciled or marketed in the UK, including material increases in required liquidity levels. Although EU authorities stated in July 2023 that they would not re-open the EU regulatory framework for MMFs in the near term, the UK’s proposed changes may increase pressure to implement similar reforms as the vast majority of MMFs sold in the UK are EU-domiciled and regulated. Such regulatory reforms could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock’s MMF products.
•ESG and Sustainability: ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. The International Sustainability Standards Board (“ISSB”) released its first two disclosure standards in 2023, which may inform national regulators’ approaches. For example, the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia have already indicated their intention to endorse these standards. In the US, the SEC has proposed a series of rules that would require, among other things: (1) corporate issuers to make substantial climate-related disclosures in periodic reports, including with respect to governance, risk management, business strategy, financial statement metrics and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and (2) enhanced ESG disclosures by investment companies and investment advisers in fund and adviser filings, including disclosures on ESG strategies and how ESG factors are considered, and GHG emissions disclosure by certain environmentally focused funds. Furthermore, the SEC has announced plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers’ and funds’ ESG strategies, policies and procedures. In addition, the US Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued final rules clarifying that Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) plan fiduciaries can, but are not required to, consider the economic effects of ESG factors for purposes of investing ERISA plan assets and exercising voting rights with respect to plan investments. Moreover, California passed several laws in 2023 that will require companies doing business in California to make certain types of climate-related disclosures, and other states may adopt similar laws.
The EU has enacted numerous regulations on ESG and sustainability, including on sustainability-related disclosures by financial market participants; integration of sustainability considerations into investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; making the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences; and requiring asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities and make detailed disclosures relating to ESG characteristics of funds and portfolios. Further regulations include the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which will require enhanced sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers, with phased implementation beginning in 2024 and for a wider group of global companies from 2028. In December 2023, the EU reached provisional agreement on a directive, which if adopted in its current form, would require a wide group of European and global companies to provide transition plans and conduct due diligence on the sustainability of their suppliers. The EU and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) are also developing rules and guidelines for the use of ESG or sustainability related terms in fund names, focused on specifying a minimum threshold of assets meeting ESG or sustainable criteria for such funds. Within the UK, the FCA has proposed UK-specific sustainability regulations, including a sustainable product classification system for funds and enhanced disclosure requirements, which are expected to apply on a staggered basis from July 2024. In addition, HMT released a consultation to bring ESG rating providers under regulation by the FCA and will consult on a UK-specific taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities.
A number of Asia-Pacific jurisdictions are consulting on sustainability reporting obligations aligned with the ISSB standards. Similarly, policymakers in Japan have announced that they are preparing a local version of the ISSB standards. Japan and Singapore have published codes of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers, with Hong Kong considering a similar approach, while India introduced a regulatory framework for ESG ratings providers in July 2023.
As jurisdictions continue to develop legal frameworks on ESG and sustainability regulations, BlackRock faces increased fragmentation risk related to local implementation, resulting in complex and potentially conflicting compliance obligations and legal and regulatory uncertainty.
Global regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and increase costs, including costs related to regulatory compliance, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
Regulatory reforms in the US expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
In recent years, a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the US, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. These risks have been heightened as the pace of regulatory rulemaking has intensified. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the US, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:
•Antitrust Rules and Guidance: In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking with amendments to rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties in certain transactions to provide the FTC and DOJ prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would significantly expand the information required to be reported and documentation to be submitted in connection with an HSR filing. If enacted as drafted, the proposed rules could substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification expenses and delay transactions. In December 2023, the FTC and DOJ also jointly issued new merger guidelines, which could impact the ability of the Company to expand its services through strategic investments or acquisitions.
•Designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”): The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the US under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In November 2023, the FSOC finalized amendments to its existing interpretive guidance to remove the prioritization of an activities-based approach over an entity-specific approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks to financial stability, although the amendment clarified that the FSOC retained the ability to use an activities-based approach when appropriate. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory and capital requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.
•US DOL Fiduciary Rule: In October 2023, the US DOL proposed a new regulation redefining the meaning of “investment advice fiduciary” under ERISA as well as amendments to several prohibited transaction exemptions applicable to investment advice fiduciaries. If adopted as proposed, the rule would substantially expand when a person would be considered a fiduciary subject to ERISA and could require BlackRock to revise a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock and its distribution partners, and limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain services to applicable clients.
•SEC Rules Governing Security-Based Swaps: In 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (“SBS”) transactions to require public reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts.
•SEC Rules on Private Fund Advisers: In 2023, the SEC adopted new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These included amendments to Form PF for registered investment advisers requiring new disclosures, filing obligations and enhanced reporting. The SEC adopted additional rules requiring registered private fund advisers to, among other things, provide quarterly reports to fund investors, obtain annual audits for funds, distribute fairness opinions in connection with certain transactions, prohibit certain types of preferential terms and treatment, and provide transparency to investors of all types of preferential treatment granted to other investors in the same fund. Implementing these rules and amendments may significantly increase BlackRock’s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock’s alternatives products.
•Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS: In 2023, the SEC re-proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of “exchange” and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules may increase compliance costs for BlackRock.
•SEC US Treasury Clearing Mandate: In December 2023, the SEC adopted rules mandating central clearing of US Treasury repurchases and certain other Treasury transactions. The rules require many market participants, including a large number of BlackRock funds and accounts, to clear Treasury repurchase transactions and potentially certain cash Treasury securities transactions through a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which could increase transaction costs for BlackRock’s clients.
•Proposed Rules on Equity Market Structure: In 2023, the SEC proposed equity market structure reforms that would significantly change how national market system (“NMS”) stock orders are priced, executed and reported. The reforms include: (1) a requirement for certain retail orders to be subject to order-by-order competition, (2) an SEC-level best execution rule and (3) an adjustment to the tick sizes at which NMS stocks can be quoted or traded. If enacted as proposed, the collective impact of the rules may adversely affect market efficiency and execution costs, which would result in negative effects for BlackRock’s business and clients.
•SEC Rules on Short Sales and Reporting of Securities Loans: In 2023, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring certain institutional managers to report short positions and activity to the SEC for publication on an aggregate basis, which could potentially impact investment strategies and result in greater operational burdens and cost for BlackRock. The SEC also adopted a new rule requiring certain persons to report information on securities loan transactions to a registered national securities association which will then publish certain information. The rule may increase BlackRock’s operational burdens and costs.
•SEC Standard Settlement Rules: In 2023, the SEC adopted amendments and new rules which, among other things, shortened the standard settlement for most securities transactions to one business day after the trade date (T+1), which will likely increase BlackRock’s operational burdens and costs.
•SEC Predictive Data Analytics Rules: The SEC proposed new rules in 2023 that would require broker-dealers and investment advisers, when engaging or communicating with investors using predictive data analytics (“PDA”) and PDA-like technologies, to evaluate such technologies for conflicts of interest and, where identified, eliminate or neutralize the conflict of interest. If adopted as proposed, the rules could encompass a wide range of forward-looking uses of technology applications and impose significant operational burdens and costs.
•SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC has recently engaged in various initiatives and reviews impacting regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. For example, the SEC adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports, adopted final amendments to the rule governing fund names, expanding the scope of the rule to fund names including growth, value, ESG or similar terms, and proposed rules governing outsourcing of certain functions by investment advisers to service providers.
Regulatory reforms in the US could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
BlackRock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the US and the Company may be affected by several proposed or implemented reform initiatives in the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific regions, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives internationally, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, key reforms in these regions include:
European Union
•Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms: The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, will become applicable beginning in January 2025. DORA will, among other things: (1) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) potentially subject Aladdin to additional oversight. In parallel with DORA, the UK proposed a new Critical Third Party regime to regulate certain third parties designated by HMT as “critical” to the financial sector, and UK regulators have issued a consultation on proposed requirements for “critical” third parties, with further consultations expected in 2024.
•Retail Investment Strategy: In 2023, the European Commission (“EC”) adopted a Retail Investment Strategy package with wide-reaching amendments intended to enhance protections for retail investors. If enacted as proposed, these changes may impact BlackRock’s operations in European markets, including product development, client servicing and distribution models.
United Kingdom
•FSMA 2023: The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (“FSMA”) reflects significant changes to the UK framework for financial services regulation, including changes that: (1) revoke retained EU law related to financial services regulation, (2) amend the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation frameworks, (3) establish a new designated activities regime and (4) reform the financial promotion regime for unauthorized firms. The UK government and FCA are expected to publish further legislation setting out specific changes impacting the UK market in 2024.
•Mansion House Reforms: The Mansion House reforms announced in July 2023 also build on the new UK regulatory framework enabled by the FSMA. Potential impacts to the asset management sector include: (1) repeal and replacement of the packaged retail and insurance based investment products (""PRIIPs"") Regulation; (2) review of the UK’s green finance strategy, including potential regulation of ESG data providers; (3) review of governance through the Senior Managers and Certification Regime; (4) repeal of EU legislation on the European Long-Term Investment Fund; (5) market infrastructure reforms; (6) reassessment of the boundary between investment advice and financial guidance; and (7) independent review of the UK investment research landscape.
•Overseas Fund Regime (“OFR”): OFR, the simplified regime through which non-UK funds can register with the FCA to be marketed to UK retail investors, was enacted in February 2022 and is expected to be implemented through 2024. OFR requires consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled to be found equivalent to the UK’s regime in order to market such funds in the UK.
•Conduct Regulation: The FCA continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the implementation of the Consumer Duty by all asset management firms, including BlackRock’s UK subsidiaries. The Consumer Duty rules require firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers in their manufacture and distribution of products and services, in respect of price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. Any failure to meet the FCA’s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk.
•UK Stewardship Code Review: The UK Financial Reporting Council has announced a planned review of the UK Stewardship Code in 2024 to consider potential revisions to address stakeholder concerns.
Asia-Pacific
•Regulatory Environment in China: The Company’s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company’s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on transfers of certain types of onshore data of the Company’s Chinese entities to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock’s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock’s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance.
International regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.
Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financial and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US state and federal as well as non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock’s shareholders. Such legal proceedings could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.
In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.
BlackRock faces increasing focus from regulators, officials, clients and other stakeholders regarding ESG matters, which may adversely impact its reputation and business.
BlackRock faces increasing focus from regulators, officials, clients and other stakeholders regarding ESG matters. BlackRock offers choice to its clients who have a variety of goals and preferences, including those who want to increase their exposure to the low-carbon transition and those who choose not to invest in products or strategies with sustainable investment objectives. BlackRock is subject to competing demands from different stakeholder groups with divergent views on ESG-related matters, including in countries in which BlackRock operates and invests, as well as in states and localities where BlackRock serves public sector clients. This divergence has and continues to increase the risk that any perceived or actual action or lack thereof by BlackRock on such matters on behalf of its clients will be viewed differently by various stakeholders and adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business, including through withdrawals, redemptions, terminations or decisions not to commit or invest new capital by clients, as well as legal and governmental action and scrutiny. Some US states and state officials have adopted or proposed legislation or otherwise have taken official positions restricting or prohibiting state government entities from doing certain business with entities identified by the state as “boycotting” or “discriminating” against particular industries or considering ESG factors in their investment processes and proxy voting. Other states and localities may adopt similar legislation or other ESG-related laws and positions that adversely impact BlackRock’s business. BlackRock may also communicate certain initiatives and goals for its corporate activities related to environmental, diversity, and other ESG-related matters. BlackRock could be criticized for the scope or nature of any initiatives or goals, or for revisions thereto. Such initiatives or goals may be difficult or costly to implement, may not advance at the anticipated pace, or be accomplished within the announced timeframe or at all. If BlackRock is not able to successfully manage ESG-related expectations across varied stakeholder interests, it may adversely affect BlackRock’s reputation, ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners or result in litigation, legal or governmental action, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may harm its business.
BlackRock’s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients, employees, shareholders and business partners. BlackRock’s reputation may be harmed by, among other factors, regulatory, enforcement or other governmental actions, technology or operational failures, poor investment performance, ineffective management or monitoring of key third-party relationships, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, privacy incidents, employee errors or misconduct, failures to manage risks or conflicts of interest, or legal actions related to BlackRock or its products and services. In addition, BlackRock’s business, scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders. This heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity and adverse actions for BlackRock and may continue to do so in the future. Any perceived or actual action or lack thereof, or perceived lack of transparency, by BlackRock on matters subject to scrutiny, such as ESG, may be viewed differently by various stakeholders and adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business, including through redemptions or terminations by clients, and legal and governmental action and scrutiny. BlackRock’s global presence and investments on behalf of its clients around the world could also lead to heightened scrutiny and criticism in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape. For example, BlackRock has received criticism from some stakeholders because of its operations and investments in certain countries on behalf of clients, including China. These criticisms could adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business. In addition, the increasing popularity of social media and non-mainstream Internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of adverse publicity or inaccurate information about BlackRock, making effective remediation more difficult. Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may impact BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
A failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions and/or adversely affect BlackRock’s business and reputation, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
As a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients, the Company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. While BlackRock has policies, controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest, identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction, adverse publicity, litigation or enforcement actions. In particular, BlackRock’s broad range of investment, advisory and technology offerings, and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions, may result in clients working with multiple BlackRock businesses and/or BlackRock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. To the extent that BlackRock fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face adverse publicity, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, client attrition, penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
A subsidiary of BlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCC regulation and capital requirements that may limit its business activities. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank. Having a subsidiary subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to the limitations imposed by such regulation.
The implications of complying with threshold limits and/or any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation, impact the performance of certain BlackRock funds and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Of note among the various regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Moreover, as BlackRock’s business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory, industry-level or issuer-specific threshold limits and scrutiny that may prevent BlackRock from holding positions in certain equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds. Although BlackRock is actively engaged in regulatory, issuer-specific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity, threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may, in turn, impact the performance of certain BlackRock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds’ benchmarks, impact the performance of certain BlackRock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities, and impede the Company's growth.
BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the scale of its index investing business, as well as purported competition issues relating to the common ownership theory.
As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing and concentrated proxy voting power. Some commentators have argued that continued growth of index funds has the potential to impact stock market competitiveness by exacerbating stock price moves and market volatility. Some commentators, regulators and lawmakers have also argued that index managers have accumulated outsized influence through the proxy voting power their clients have assigned them. Some have proposed limitations on the ability of index fund managers to vote on behalf of their clients, or that voting and engagement on certain topics should trigger changes in regulatory status. Additional commentary focuses on the common ownership theory, an academic theory stating that minority ownership of multiple companies within a single industry by the same investor leads to anticompetitive effects. This theory purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation and lower wages and employment rates, among other things. In the US, the FTC cited common ownership as a disqualifying factor in a proposed exemption from pre-merger notification rules and as a consideration underlying its consultation on rules applying to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities. In 2021, the FTC identified common ownership as a key enforcement area and passed a resolution empowering individual commissioners to investigate shareholder conduct in connection with common ownership. In 2023, the FTC and DOJ released new merger guidelines recognizing that common ownership may reduce competitive incentives. Common ownership may be given greater consideration in regulatory investigations, studies, rule proposals, policy decisions and/or the scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions. The debate on common ownership is still on the agenda of competition regulators globally, and common ownership may continue to be a consideration for the EC, among others, including in the assessment of mergers and investigations. For example, EC and European Parliament reports in 2020 suggested that more evidence was required on the impact of common ownership on competition, and a committee of the Australian House of Representatives held an inquiry in 2021 on the implications of common ownership and capital concentration on Australian companies and markets. In 2023, the UK Competition & Markets Authority (“CMA”) established a new economic research unit which identified common ownership as a potential research topic. There is substantial literature casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with the common ownership theory and competition regulators, including at the FTC and CMA, have acknowledged that the debate around the theory remains unsettled. Nevertheless, some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on the ownership stakes of common owners that, if enacted into policy, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, as well as increase costs and limit the availability of products for investors. Such policy solutions could, in turn, adversely affect BlackRock.
New tax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.
BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. Legislation at both the US federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the EC has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15% (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” Framework). EU member states adopted, or plan to adopt, laws implementing the OECD’s minimum tax rules under the Pillar Two Framework, which are expected to go into effect in 2024. Several other countries, including the UK, have changed or are considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD’s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which BlackRock does business have and may continue to change, and any such changes could increase its tax liabilities. The Company is continuing to monitor legislative developments and evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two Framework on future periods.
The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.",,,,,5676.0,,0.0,14:28:07,True,True,"[nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan

Acquisitions
In January 2024, BlackRock announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the business and assets of GIP, a leading independent infrastructure fund manager, for $3 billion in cash and approximately 12 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Approximately 30% of the total consideration, all in stock, will be deferred and will be issued subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing events. The Company believes the combination of GIP with BlackRock’s complementary infrastructure offerings will create a broad global infrastructure franchise with differentiated origination and asset management capabilities. The GIP Transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
In May 2024, BlackRock completed the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in SpiderRock Advisors (“SRA”), a leading provider of customized option overlay strategies in the United States (“US”) wealth market. This transaction expands on BlackRock’s minority investment in SRA made in 2021 and reinforces BlackRock’s commitment to personalized separately managed accounts. The financial impact of the transaction is not material to BlackRock's condensed consolidated financial statements.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2023
GAAP. Operating income of $1.7 billion increased $255 million and operating margin of 35.8% increased 190 bps from the three months ended March 31, 2023. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected higher base fees, driven by the impact of higher markets on average AUM and organic base fee growth, and higher performance fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher expenses, reflecting higher employee compensation and benefits expense, sales, asset and account expense, and general and administration expense.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) increased $66 million from the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven primarily by higher interest and dividend income and mark-to-market gains on certain minority investments, partially offset by higher interest expense.
First quarter 2024 income tax expense included a discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure. This discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the intellectual property reorganization. In addition, first quarter 2024 income tax expense included $28 million of discrete tax benefits, including a benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter. First quarter 2023 income tax expense included a $38 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2023, offset by a $38 million discrete tax expense related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $2.84, or 37%, from the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher operating income, a lower effective tax rate, and higher nonoperating income in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1.8 billion increased $264 million and operating margin of 42.2% increased 180 bps from the three months ended March 31, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.88, or 24%, from the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting higher operating and nonoperating income, and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Income tax expense, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2024 excluded the $137 million of benefit described above.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP.
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP financial measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

(1)Non-GAAP adjustments, excluding income tax matters, are net of tax.
(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•Operating income, as adjusted, includes the following non-GAAP expense adjustments:
(a)Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred cash compensation plans. The Company excludes compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, which the Company hedges economically. For these deferred cash compensation plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed to employees in cash upon vesting is determined based on the returns on specified investment funds. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the appreciation (depreciation) of the deferred cash compensation liability in proportion to the vested amount of the award during a respective period, while the gain (loss) to economically hedge these plans is immediately recognized in nonoperating income (expense), which creates a timing difference impacting net income. This timing difference will reverse and offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multi-year vesting period. Management believes excluding market valuation changes related to the deferred cash compensation plans in the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, provides useful disclosure to both management and investors of the Company’s financial performance over time as these amounts are economically hedged, while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(b)Acquisition related costs. Acquisition related costs include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including professional fees and compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(c)Lease costs - New York. In 2023, the Company continued to recognize lease expense within general and administration expense for both its current headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York and prior headquarters until the Company's lease on its prior headquarters expired in April 2023. The Company began lease payments related to its current headquarters in May 2023, but began recording lease expense in August 2021 when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. Prior to the Company’s move to its current headquarters in February 2023, the impact of lease costs related to 50 Hudson Yards was excluded from operating income, as adjusted. In February 2023, the Company completed the majority of its move to 50 Hudson Yards and no longer excluded the impact of these lease costs. Subsequently, from February 2023 through April 2023, the Company excluded the impact of lease costs related to the Company's prior headquarters. Management believes excluding the impact of these respective New York lease costs (“Lease costs - New York”) when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and ongoing operations, and enhances comparability among periods presented.
•Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.
(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, excludes the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of certain deferred cash compensation plans. As the gain (loss) on investments and derivatives used to hedge these compensation plans over time substantially offsets the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on these deferred cash compensation plans, which is included in operating income, GAAP basis, management believes excluding the gain (loss) from the economic hedge of the deferred cash compensation plans when calculating nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure for both management and investors of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value.
(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amount for income tax matters includes a discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure. This discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the intellectual property reorganization.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

(1)Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(2)Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing four months.
(3)Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM increased $464 billion to $10.5 trillion at March 31, 2024, driven by net market appreciation and net inflows, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $76 billion were comprised of net inflows of $67 billion, $7 billion and $2 billion from ETFs, retail and institutional clients, respectively. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•ETFs net inflows of $67 billion were led by net inflows of $37 billion into core equity ETFs, $18 billion into fixed income ETFs and $13 billion into alternatives ETFs. Alternatives ETFs net inflows were driven by flows into the Company's Bitcoin ETF.
•Retail net inflows of $7 billion primarily reflected net inflows into equity and fixed income.
•Institutional active net inflows of $15 billion were led by LifePath® targe-date strategies and outsourcing mandates.
•Institutional index net outflows of $13 billion primarily reflected equity net outflows, partially offset by fixed income net inflows.
Cash management AUM decreased to $746 billion, driven by seasonal net outflows from US government money market funds.
Net market appreciation of $476 billion was primarily driven by global equity market appreciation.
AUM decreased $70 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Japanese yen and the euro.

•ETFs net inflows of $231 billion were driven by net inflows into core equity and bond ETFs.
•Institutional active net inflows of $30 billion were led by multi-asset net inflows and included the impact of several significant outsourcing mandates and continued growth of the Company's LifePath target-date strategies.
•Institutional index net outflows of $77 billion primarily reflected $113 billion of equity net outflows, partially offset by $40 billion of fixed income net inflows, as some clients sought to de-risk or rebalance.
Cash management AUM increased to $746 billion, due to net inflows from US government and international money market funds.
Net market appreciation of $1.2 trillion was driven by global equity market appreciation.
AUM decreased $47 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Japanese yen.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2023
Revenue increased $485 million, or 11%, from the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily driven by the positive impact of markets on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and higher performance fees and technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3.8 billion increased $276 million from $3.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily driven by the impact of market beta on average AUM, positive organic base fee growth and the effect of one additional day in the current quarter, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $151 million decreased from $167 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily reflecting lower spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $204 million increased $149 million from $55 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting higher revenue from both illiquid and liquid alternative products.
Technology services revenue of $377 million increased $37 million from $340 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting sustained demand for Aladdin technology offerings.
Total advisory and other revenue of $59 million increased $32 million from $27 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting higher transition management assignments and the impact of presenting earnings (losses) from certain equity method minority investments within nonoperating income (expense) beginning in the first quarter of 2024.

(1)Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, BlackRock updated the presentation of the Company’s expense line items within the consolidated statements of income by including a new “sales, asset, and account expense” income statement caption. Such expense line items have been recast for 2023 to conform to this new presentation. For a recast of 2023 expense line items, see page 12 of Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 12, 2024.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2023
Expense increased $230 million, or 8%, from the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting higher employee compensation and benefits expense, sales, asset and account expense and general and administration expense.
Employee compensation and benefits expense of $1.6 billion increased $153 million from $1.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting higher incentive compensation, primarily as a result of higher operating income and performance fees.
Sales, assets and account expense of $888 million increased $42 million from $846 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by higher direct fund expense and distribution and servicing costs, primarily reflecting higher average AUM.
General and administration expense of $529 million increased $34 million from $495 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to higher technology and professional services expense including higher acquisition-related expenses in the current quarter.

2024. Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included a discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure. This discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the reorganization. In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 income tax expense included $28 million of discrete tax benefits, including a benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15% (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” Framework). European Union member states adopted, or plan to adopt, laws implementing the OECD’s minimum tax rules under the Pillar Two Framework effective starting in 2024. Several other countries, including the UK, have changed or are considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD’s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which BlackRock does business have and may continue to change, and any such changes could increase its tax liabilities. The Pillar Two Framework did not have a material impact on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the Company is continuing to monitor legislative developments and evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two Framework on future periods.
2023. Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included a $38 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter, offset by a $38 million discrete tax expense related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products (""CIPs"").
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom (""UK""), and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2023 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included $382 million and $288 million, respectively, of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended March 31, 2024). Accounts receivable at March 31, 2024 increased $45 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher base fee receivables. Investments at March 31, 2024 increased $597 million from December 31, 2023 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets at March 31, 2024 decreased $41 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets at March 31, 2024 increased $831 million from December 31, 2023, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities).
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at March 31, 2024 decreased $1.3 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily due to 2023 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by 2024 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable increased $205 million due to higher current income taxes payable. Other liabilities at March 31, 2024 increased $801 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets). Net deferred income tax liabilities at March 31, 2024 decreased $50 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with the intellectual property reorganization, partially offset by stock-based compensation.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $10.3 billion and $9.7 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the NCI portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the economic portion of investments that is owned by the Company as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred cash compensation investments and hedged exposures, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred cash compensation plans is substantially offset by a change in associated compensation expense, and the impact of the portfolio of seed investments is mitigated by futures entered into as part of the Company's macro hedging strategy. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends and repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred cash compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments.
Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $378 million and primarily reflected $476 million of net investment purchases and $64 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $162 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.
Cash flows provided by financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $707 million, primarily resulting from $3.0 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings related to the issuance by BlackRock Funding of senior notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the GIP Transaction, partially offset by $1.0 billion of repayment of borrowings, $795 million of cash dividend payments, $634 million of share repurchases, including $375 million in open market transactions and $259 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements.

(1)The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.

Total liquidity resources increased $544 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily reflecting $3.0 billion of proceeds from the 2024 Notes and cash flows from other operating activities, partially offset by payments of 2023 year-end incentive awards, repayment of borrowings of $1.0 billion, cash dividend payments of $795 million, and share repurchases of $634 million.
A significant portion of the Company’s $8.4 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 0.5 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $375 million. At March 31, 2024, there were approximately 5.3 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.8 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2024 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility with a March 2028 maturity date, which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the “2024 credit facility”). In March 2024, the 2024 credit facility was amended to, among other things, (1) permit the proposed acquisition of GIP and the transactions contemplated in connection with the GIP Transaction, (2) add BlackRock Funding, Inc., a Delaware corporation and currently a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock (“BlackRock Funding”), as a borrower under the existing credit agreement, (3) add BlackRock Funding as a guarantor of the payment and performance of the obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of BlackRock and certain of its other subsidiaries and (4) update the sustainability-linked pricing mechanics to allow metrics to be set following the consummation of the GIP Transaction. The 2024 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2024 credit facility from $5 billion as of March 31, 2024, to an aggregate principal amount of up to $6 billion. Interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at an applicable benchmark rate for the denominated currency of the loan, plus a spread. The 2024 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at March 31, 2024. At March 31, 2024, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2024 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2024 credit facility. At March 31, 2024, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Subsidiary Credit Facility. In January 2024, BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (""BIM UK""), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Subsidiary Credit Facility”) in the amount of £25 million (or approximately $32 million based on the GBP/USD foreign exchange rate at March 31, 2024) with a rolling 364-day term structure. The Subsidiary Credit Facility is available for BIM UK's general corporate and working capital purposes. At March 31, 2024, there was no amount outstanding under the Subsidiary Credit Facility.
Long-Term Borrowings
2024 Notes. In March 2024, BlackRock Funding issued $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $500 million of 4.70% notes maturing on March 14, 2029 (the ""2029 Notes""), $1.0 billion of 5.00% notes maturing on March 14, 2034 (the ""2034 Notes"") and $1.5 billion of 5.25% notes maturing on March 14, 2054 (the ""2054 Notes"") (collectively, the ""2024 Notes""). Net proceeds are intended to be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the GIP Transaction, which is expected to close in third quarter of 2024. Interest on the 2024 Notes of approximately $152 million per year is payable semi-annually on March 14 and September 14 of each year, beginning September 14, 2024. The 2024 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “Guarantee”) on a senior unsecured basis by BlackRock. The 2024 Notes and the Guarantee rank equally in right of payment with all of BlackRock Funding and BlackRock’s other unsubordinated indebtedness, respectively. The 2024 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of BlackRock Funding at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable series of 2024 Notes. In addition, if the GIP Transaction is not consummated, BlackRock Funding will be required to redeem all outstanding 2029 Notes and 2034 Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a Special Mandatory Redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of 2024 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption date. Upon completion of a Special Mandatory Redemption, either (a) BlackRock may assume the obligations of BlackRock Funding under the 2054 Notes or (b) BlackRock Funding may merge with and into BlackRock as a result of which transaction the separate legal existence of BlackRock Funding would cease, and, in either case, BlackRock Funding will be released under the indenture governing the 2054 Notes and BlackRock will be released from the note guarantees, but will instead become the primary (and sole) obligor under the 2054 Notes and the related indenture provisions. In the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption, the proceeds of the 2054 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of outstanding indebtedness.
At March 31, 2024, the principal amount of long-term notes outstanding was $10.0 billion. See Note 14, Borrowings, in the 2023 Form 10-K for more information on overall borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2023.
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company paid approximately $51 million of interest on long-term notes. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at March 31, 2024 were as follows:

Supplemental Guarantor Information
BlackRock Funding is a recently formed, wholly owned direct subsidiary of BlackRock formed in connection with the GIP Transaction, which is expected to close in third quarter of 2024. BlackRock Funding is the issuer of the previously described 2024 Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by BlackRock. The 2024 Notes and the Guarantee rank equally in right of payment with all of BlackRock Funding and BlackRock’s other unsubordinated indebtedness, respectively. No other subsidiary of BlackRock or BlackRock Funding guarantees the 2024 Notes. The Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, and BlackRock will be released from all obligations under the indenture in its capacity as guarantor, in certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. See Note 13, Borrowings, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the 2024 Notes.
As permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, BlackRock has excluded summarized financial information for BlackRock Funding in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of BlackRock Funding are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in BlackRock’s condensed consolidated financial statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At March 31, 2024, the Company had $781 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity funds and real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert absolute control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once its economic interest falls below 10%. As of March 31, 2024, the Company was deemed to be the PB of approximately 100 VIEs. See Note 5, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Fair Value Disclosures, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts (“SMAs”). These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. Such performance fees are recognized when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal. Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgment is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to (a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or (b) distribute their sales proceeds and determine the timing of such distributions.
The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.8 billion of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees and other third parties. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 15, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.","Item 1A.

SUMMARY OF REVENUE Highlights • Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue increased $264 million from the second quarter of 2023 and $97 million from the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by positive organic base fee growth and the impact of market beta on average AUM. Securities lending revenue of $154 million decreased from $184 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower spreads. • Performance fees increased $46 million from the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting higher revenue from liquid alternatives and long-only products, partially offset by lower revenue from illiquid alternatives. Performance fees decreased $40 million from the first quarter of 2024, reflecting lower revenue from illiquid and liquid alternative products, partially offset by higher revenue from long-only products. • Technology services revenue increased $36 million from the second quarter of 2023 and $18 million from the first quarter of 2024, reflecting sustained demand for Aladdin technology offerings. Technology services annual contract value (“ACV”)(1) increased 10% from the second quarter of 2023. (1) See note (4) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on page 17 for more information on ACV. SUMMARY OF OPERATING EXPENSE (1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. updated the presentation of the Company’s expense line items within the consolidated statements of income by including a new “sales, asset and account expense” income statement caption. Such expense line items have been recast for 2023 to conform to this new presentation. For a recast of 2023 expense line items, see page 12 of Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on . Highlights • Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $74 million from the second quarter of 2023, reflecting higher incentive compensation, primarily as a result of higher operating income and performance fees. Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $77 million from the first quarter of 2024, reflecting lower incentive compensation driven by lower performance fees and higher seasonal payroll taxes in the prior quarter, partially offset by the impact of higher operating income. • Sales, asset and account expense increased $40 million from the second quarter of 2023 and $41 million from the first quarter of 2024, driven by higher distribution and servicing costs and direct fund expense, primarily reflecting higher average AUM. • General and administration expense increased $41 million from the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher professional services expense, including higher acquisition-related transaction costs, and higher technology expense in the current quarter. SUMMARY OF NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), LESS NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (1) Amounts relate to the gains (losses) from economically hedging certain BlackRock deferred cash compensation plans. (2) Management believes nonoperating income (expense), net of NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impacts BlackRock’s book value. For more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP, see notes to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on pages 14-17. (3) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to credit funds, direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions. (4) Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to BlackRock’s seed investment portfolio, net of impact of certain hedges. (5) Amounts for the three and six months ended , include earnings (losses) from certain equity method minority investments, which the Company recorded within nonoperating income (expense) beginning in the first quarter of 2024 and noncash pre-tax gains (losses) related to the revaluation of certain minority investments. In addition, amount for the three and six months ended  includes a noncash pre-tax gain in connection with the SpiderRock Transaction of approximately $19 million. SUMMARY OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE Highlights • First quarter 2024 income tax expense included a discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure. This discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the intellectual property reorganization. In addition, first quarter 2024 income tax expense included $28 million of discrete tax benefits, including a benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter. RECONCILIATION OF GAAP OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN TO OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN, AS ADJUSTED (1) Amounts included within general and administration expense. See note (1) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on page 16 for more information on as adjusted items. RECONCILIATION OF GAAP NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) TO NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), LESS NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NCI, AS ADJUSTED See notes (1) and (2) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on pages 16 and 17 for more information on as adjusted items. RECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO BLACKROCK TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO BLACKROCK, AS ADJUSTED (1) Non-GAAP adjustments, excluding income tax matters, are net of tax. See note (3) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information on page 17 for more information on as adjusted items. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP financial measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Computations and reconciliations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows: (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers. • Operating income, as adjusted, includes the following non-GAAP expense adjustments: (a) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred cash compensation plans. The Company excludes compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, which the Company hedges economically. For these deferred cash compensation plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed to employees in cash upon vesting is determined based on the returns on specified investment funds. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the appreciation (depreciation) of the deferred cash compensation liability in proportion to the vested amount of the award during a respective period, while the net gain (loss) to economically hedge these plans is immediately recognized in nonoperating income (expense), which creates a timing difference impacting net income. This timing difference will reverse and offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multi-year vesting period. Management believes excluding market valuation changes related to the deferred cash compensation plans in the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, provides useful disclosure to both management and investors of the Company’s financial performance over time as these amounts are economically hedged, while also increasing comparability with other companies. (b) Acquisition related costs. Acquisition related costs include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including professional services expense and compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies. (c) Lease costs - New York. In 2023, the Company continued to recognize lease expense within general and administration expense for both its current headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York and prior headquarters until the Company’s lease on its prior headquarters expired in April 2023. The Company began lease payments related to its current headquarters in May 2023, but began recording lease expense in August 2021 when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. Prior to the Company’s move to its current headquarters in February 2023, the impact of lease costs related to 50 Hudson Yards was excluded from operating income, as adjusted. In February 2023, the Company completed the majority of its move to 50 Hudson Yards and no longer excluded the impact of these lease costs. Subsequently, from February 2023 through April 2023, the Company excluded the impact of lease costs related to the Company’s prior headquarters. Management believes excluding the impact of these respective New York lease costs (“Lease costs - New York”) when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and ongoing operations, and enhances comparability among periods presented. • Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries. (2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, excludes the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of certain deferred cash compensation plans. As the gain (loss) on investments and derivatives used to hedge these compensation plans over time substantially offsets the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on these deferred cash compensation plans, which is included in operating income, GAAP basis, management believes excluding the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of the deferred cash compensation plans when calculating nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure for both management and investors of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value. (3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amount for income tax matters in the first quarter of 2024 includes a discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure. This discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the intellectual property reorganization. Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. (4) ACV: Management believes ACV is an effective metric for reviewing BlackRock’s technology services’ ongoing contribution to its operating results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods while also providing a useful supplemental metric for both management and investors of BlackRock’s growth in technology services revenue over time, as it is linked to the net new business in technology services. ACV represents forward-looking, annualized estimated value of the recurring subscription fees under client contracts, assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed, unless we have received a notice of termination, even though such notice may not be effective until a later date. ACV also includes the annualized estimated value of new sales, for existing and new clients, when we execute client contracts, even though the recurring fees may not be effective until a later date and excludes nonrecurring fees such as implementation and consulting fees.

Acquisitions
In January 2024, BlackRock announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the business and assets of GIP, a leading independent infrastructure fund manager, for $3 billion in cash and approximately 12 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Approximately 30% of the total consideration, all in stock, will be deferred and will be issued subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing events. The Company believes the combination of GIP with BlackRock’s complementary infrastructure offerings will create a broad global infrastructure franchise with differentiated origination and asset management capabilities. The GIP Transaction is expected to close around the end of the third quarter of 2024 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
In May 2024, BlackRock completed the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in SpiderRock Advisors (“SRA”), a leading provider of customized option overlay strategies in the United States (“US”) wealth market (the ""SpiderRock Transaction""). This transaction expands on BlackRock’s minority investment in SRA made in 2021 and reinforces BlackRock’s commitment to personalized separately managed accounts.
In June 2024, BlackRock announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the business and assets of Preqin, a leading independent provider of private markets data, for £2.55 billion (or approximately $3.2 billion based on the GBP/USD foreign exchange rate at June 30, 2024) in cash. The Company believes bringing together Preqin's data and research tools with the complementary workflows of Aladdin and eFront in a unified platform will create a preeminent private markets technology and data provider. The Preqin Transaction is expected to close before year-end 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2023
GAAP. Operating income of $1.8 billion increased $185 million and operating margin of 37.5% increased 130 bps from the three months ended June 30, 2023. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected higher investment advisory and administration fees (collectively ""base fees""), driven by positive organic base fee growth, the impact of higher markets on average AUM, and higher performance fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher expenses, reflecting higher employee compensation and benefits expense, general and administration expense, and higher sales, asset and account expense.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) decreased $22 million from the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven primarily by lower mark-to-market gains on the revaluation of private equity co-investments and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income, mark-to-market revaluation of un-hedged seed capital investments, and higher mark-to-market gains on certain minority investments. In addition, amount for the three months ended June 30, 2024 included a $19 million pre-tax gain in connection with the SpiderRock Transaction.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $0.93, or 10%, from the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher operating income in the current quarter.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $1.9 billion increased $206 million and operating margin of 44.1% increased 160 bps from the three months ended June 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.08, or 12%, from the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher operating income.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2023
GAAP. Operating income of $3.5 billion increased $440 million and operating margin of 36.6% increased 150 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2023. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected higher base fees, driven by organic base fee growth, the impact of higher markets on average AUM, and higher performance fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher expenses, reflecting higher employee compensation and benefits expense, sales, asset and account expense, and general and administration expense.
Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI increased $44 million from the six months ended June 30, 2023, driven primarily by higher interest and dividend income, mark-to-market revaluation of un-hedged seed capital investments, and higher mark-to-market gains on certain minority investments, partially offset by lower mark-to-market gains on the revaluation of private equity co-investments and higher interest expense.
Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 included a discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure. This discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the intellectual property reorganization.
Earnings per diluted common share increased $3.77 or 23%, from the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher operating and nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate.
As Adjusted. Operating income of $3.7 billion increased $470 million and operating margin of 43.1% increased 160 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share increased $2.96, or 17%, from the six months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting higher operating and nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate. Income tax expense, as adjusted, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 excluded the $137 million of benefit described above.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP.
For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP financial measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

(1)Non-GAAP adjustments, excluding income tax matters, are net of tax.
(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
•Operating income, as adjusted, includes the following non-GAAP expense adjustments:
(a)Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred cash compensation plans. The Company excludes compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans, which the Company hedges economically. For these deferred cash compensation plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed to employees in cash upon vesting is determined based on the returns on specified investment funds. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the appreciation (depreciation) of the deferred cash compensation liability in proportion to the vested amount of the award during a respective period, while the net gain (loss) to economically hedge these plans is immediately recognized in nonoperating income (expense), which creates a timing difference impacting net income. This timing difference will reverse and offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multi-year vesting period. Management believes excluding market valuation changes related to the deferred cash compensation plans in the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, provides useful disclosure to both management and investors of the Company’s financial performance over time as these amounts are economically hedged, while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(b)Acquisition related costs. Acquisition related costs include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including professional services expense and compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company’s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies.
(c)Lease costs - New York. In 2023, the Company continued to recognize lease expense within general and administration expense for both its current headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York and prior headquarters until the Company's lease on its prior headquarters expired in April 2023. The Company began lease payments related to its current headquarters in May 2023, but began recording lease expense in August 2021 when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. Prior to the Company’s move to its current headquarters in February 2023, the impact of lease costs related to 50 Hudson Yards was excluded from operating income, as adjusted. In February 2023, the Company completed the majority of its move to 50 Hudson Yards and no longer excluded the impact of these lease costs. Subsequently, from February 2023 through April 2023, the Company excluded the impact of lease costs related to the Company's prior headquarters. Management believes excluding the impact of these respective New York lease costs (“Lease costs - New York”) when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company’s financial performance and ongoing operations, and enhances comparability among periods presented.
•Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.
(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, excludes the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of certain deferred cash compensation plans. As the gain (loss) on investments and derivatives used to hedge these compensation plans over time substantially offsets the compensation expense related to the market valuation changes on these deferred cash compensation plans, which is included in operating income, GAAP basis, management believes excluding the gain (loss) on the economic hedge of the deferred cash compensation plans when calculating nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure for both management and investors of BlackRock’s nonoperating results that impact book value.
(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for income tax matters in 2024 include a discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure. This discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the intellectual property reorganization.
Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.
ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

AUM increased $173 billion to $10.6 trillion at June 30, 2024 from $10.5 trillion at March 31, 2024, driven by net market appreciation and net inflows, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $51 billion were comprised of net inflows of $83 billion and $6 billion from ETFs and retail, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $37 billion from institutional clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•ETFs net inflows of $83 billion were led by fixed income and core equity ETFs, which saw $34 billion and $32 billion of net inflows, respectively.
•Retail net inflows of $6 billion reflected net inflows into equity and fixed income.
•Institutional active net outflows of $2 billion were impacted by an approximately $20 billion redemption from a single fixed income client.
•Institutional index net outflows of $35 billion were concentrated in low-fee index equities, partially offset by fixed income net inflows.
Cash management AUM increased to $778 billion, driven by net inflows from US government, international, and prime money market funds.
Net market appreciation of $123 billion was primarily driven by global equity market appreciation.
AUM decreased $35 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Japanese yen.

(1)Amounts include AUM attributable to the SpiderRock Transaction.
(2)Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(3)Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing seven months.
(4)Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM increased $637 billion to $10.6 trillion at June 30, 2024 from $10.0 trillion at December 31, 2023, driven by net market appreciation and net inflows, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $128 billion were comprised of net inflows of $150 billion and $13 billion from ETFs and retail, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $35 billion from institutional clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•ETFs net inflows of $150 billion were led by core equity and fixed income ETFs, which saw $69 billion and $53 billion of net inflows, respectively, and $18 billion into BlackRock's Bitcoin exchange-traded product (""ETP"").
•Retail net inflows of $13 billion primarily reflected net inflows into equity and fixed income.
•Institutional active net inflows of $13 billion were led by LifePath® targe-date strategies and outsourcing mandates and were impacted by the previously mentioned single client fixed income redemption.
•Institutional index net outflows of $48 billion were concentrated in low-fee index equities, partially offset by fixed income net inflows with client asset allocation activity.
Cash management AUM increased to $778 billion, driven by net inflows from prime and international money market funds.
Net market appreciation of $599 billion was primarily driven by global equity market appreciation.
AUM decreased $106 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Japanese yen and the euro.

(2)Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.
(3)Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
(4)Amounts include commodity ETFs.
AUM increased $1.2 trillion to $10.6 trillion at June 30, 2024 from $9.4 trillion at June 30, 2023, driven by net market appreciation and net inflows, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Long-term net inflows of $178 billion were comprised primarily of net inflows of $267 billion from ETFs, partially offset by net outflows of $89 billion from institutional clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.
•ETFs net inflows of $267 billion were led by core equity and fixed income ETFs, which saw $135 billion and $96 billion of net inflows, respectively, and $11 billion into alternatives ETFs. Alternatives ETFs net inflows were driven by flows into the Company's Bitcoin ETP.
•Institutional active net inflows of $19 billion were led by multi-asset net inflows and included the impact of several significant outsourcing mandates and continued growth of the Company's LifePath target-date strategies, partially offset by the impact of the previously mentioned single client fixed income redemption.
•Institutional index net outflows of $108 billion primarily reflected $144 billion of equity net outflows, partially offset by $39 billion of fixed income net inflows, as some clients sought to de-risk or rebalance.
Cash management AUM increased to $778 billion, primarily due to net inflows from international and US government money market funds.
Net market appreciation of $1.1 trillion was driven by global equity market appreciation.
AUM decreased $76 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Japanese yen and the euro.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2023
Revenue increased $342 million, or 8%, from the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by organic base fee growth, the positive impact of markets on average AUM, and higher performance fees and technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $3.9 billion increased $264 million from $3.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by positive organic base fee growth and the impact of market beta on average AUM, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $154 million decreased from $184 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting lower spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $164 million increased $46 million from $118 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting higher revenue from liquid alternatives and long-only products, partially offset by lower revenue from illiquid alternatives.
Technology services revenue of $395 million increased $36 million from $359 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting sustained demand for Aladdin technology offerings.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2023
Revenue increased $827 million, or 9%, from the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by organic base fee growth, the positive impact of markets on average AUM, and higher performance fees and technology services revenue.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $7.7 billion increased $540 million from $7.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by organic base fee growth and the impact of market beta on average AUM, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $305 million decreased from $351 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting lower spreads.
Investment advisory performance fees of $368 million increased $195 million from $173 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher revenue from both illiquid and liquid alternative products.
Technology services revenue of $772 million increased $73 million from $699 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting sustained demand for Aladdin technology offerings.
Advisory and other revenue of $112 million increased $29 million from $83 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting higher transition management assignments and the impact of presenting earnings (losses) from certain equity method minority investments within nonoperating income (expense) beginning in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower revenue from advisory assignments.

2024. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 included a discrete tax benefit of $137 million recognized in connection with the reorganization and establishment of a more efficient global intellectual property and technology platform and corporate structure. This discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the reorganization. In addition, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 income tax expense included $37 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2024.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15% (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” Framework). European Union member states adopted, or plan to adopt, laws implementing the OECD’s minimum tax rules under the Pillar Two Framework effective starting in 2024. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom (""UK""), have changed or are considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD’s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which BlackRock does business have and may continue to change, and any such changes could increase its tax liabilities. The Pillar Two Framework did not have a material impact on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and the Company is continuing to monitor legislative developments and evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two Framework on future periods.
2023. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 included $40 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in the first quarter of 2023, offset by a $38 million discrete tax expense related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OVERVIEW
As Adjusted Statement of Financial Condition
The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products (""CIPs"").
The Company presents the as adjusted statement of financial condition as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products
The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2023 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.
The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents, or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.
Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2024 included $226 million of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended June 30, 2024). Accounts receivable at June 30, 2024 increased $71 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher base fee receivables. Investments at June 30, 2024 increased $476 million from December 31, 2023 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets at June 30, 2024 increased $88 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the SpiderRock Transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. Other assets at June 30, 2024 increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities).
Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at June 30, 2024 decreased $937 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to 2023 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by 2024 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at June 30, 2024 increased $111 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher interest on borrowings and increased accruals. Other liabilities at June 30, 2024 increased $1.2 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets). Net deferred income tax liabilities at June 30, 2024 decreased $101 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with the intellectual property reorganization and capitalized costs, partially offset by stock-based compensation.
Investments
The Company’s investments were $10.2 billion and $9.7 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the NCI portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the economic portion of investments that is owned by the Company as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.
The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred cash compensation investments and hedged exposures, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred cash compensation plans is substantially offset by a change in associated compensation expense, and the impact of the portfolio of seed investments is mitigated by futures entered into as part of the Company's macro hedging strategy. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs
The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends and repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing.
Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred cash compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments.
Cash flows provided by investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $144 million and primarily reflecting $317 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees, partially offset by $74 million related to the SpiderRock Transaction and $71 million of net purchases of property and equipment.
Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $545 million, primarily resulting from $1.6 billion of cash dividend payments, $1.2 billion of share repurchases, including $875 million in open market transactions and $275 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $1.0 billion of repayment of borrowings, partially offset by $3.0 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings related to the issuance of senior notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the GIP Transaction.
The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements.

(1)The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.
(2)The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s US subsidiaries was approximately 65% and 50% at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.
Total liquidity resources increased $2.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting $3.0 billion of proceeds from the March 2024 Notes and cash flows from other operating activities, partially offset by payments of 2023 year-end incentive awards, cash dividend payments of $1.6 billion, share repurchases of $1.2 billion, repayment of borrowings of $1.0 billion and $74 million related to the SpiderRock Transaction.
A significant portion of the Company’s $8.0 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
Share Repurchases. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.1 million common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $875 million. At June 30, 2024, there were approximately 4.6 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.
Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
Short-Term Borrowings
2024 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility, which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the “2024 credit facility”). In March 2024, the 2024 credit facility was amended to, among other things, (1) permit the GIP Transaction and the transactions contemplated in connection with the GIP Transaction, (2) add BlackRock Funding, Inc., a Delaware corporation and currently a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock (“BlackRock Funding”), as a borrower under the existing credit agreement, (3) add BlackRock Funding as a guarantor of the payment and performance of the obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of BlackRock and certain of its other subsidiaries and (4) update the sustainability-linked pricing mechanics to allow metrics to be set following the consummation of the GIP Transaction. In May 2024, the 2024 credit facility was further amended to, among other things, (1) increase the aggregate commitment amount by $400 million to $5.4 billion and (2) extend the maturity date to March 2029 for lenders (other than one non-extending lender) pursuant to the Company’s option to request extensions of the maturity date available under the 2024 credit facility (with the commitment of the non-extending lender maturing in March 2028). The 2024 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2024 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $6.4 billion. Interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at an applicable benchmark rate for the denominated currency of the loan, plus a spread. The 2024 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at June 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2024 credit facility.
Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2024 credit facility. At June 30, 2024, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
Subsidiary Credit Facility. In January 2024, BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (""BIM UK""), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Subsidiary Credit Facility”) in the amount of £25 million (or approximately $32 million based on the GBP/USD foreign exchange rate at June 30, 2024) with a rolling 364-day term structure. The Subsidiary Credit Facility is available for BIM UK's general corporate and working capital purposes. At June 30, 2024, there was no amount outstanding under the Subsidiary Credit Facility.
Long-Term Borrowings
March 2024 Notes. In March 2024, BlackRock Funding issued $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $500 million of 4.70% notes maturing on March 14, 2029 (the ""2029 Notes""), $1.0 billion of 5.00% notes maturing on March 14, 2034 (the ""2034 Notes"") and $1.5 billion of 5.25% notes maturing on March 14, 2054 (the ""2054 Notes"") (collectively, the ""March 2024 Notes""). Net proceeds are intended to be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the GIP Transaction, which is expected to close in third quarter of 2024. Interest on the March 2024 Notes of approximately $152 million per year is payable semi-annually on March 14 and September 14 of each year, beginning September 14, 2024. The March 2024 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “March 2024 Notes Guarantee”) on a senior unsecured basis by BlackRock. The March 2024 Notes and the March 2024 Notes Guarantee rank equally in right of payment with all of BlackRock Funding and BlackRock’s other unsubordinated indebtedness, respectively. The March 2024 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of BlackRock Funding at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable series of March 2024 Notes. In addition, if the GIP Transaction is not consummated, BlackRock Funding will be required to redeem all outstanding 2029 Notes and 2034 Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a Special Mandatory Redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of March 2024 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption date. Upon completion of a Special Mandatory Redemption, either (a) BlackRock may assume the obligations of BlackRock Funding under the 2054 Notes or (b) BlackRock Funding may merge with and into BlackRock as a result of which transaction the separate legal existence of BlackRock Funding would cease, and, in either case, BlackRock Funding will be released under the indenture governing the 2054 Notes and BlackRock will be released from the March 2024 Notes Guarantees, but will instead become the primary (and sole) obligor under the 2054 Notes and the related indenture provisions. In the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption, the proceeds of the 2054 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of outstanding indebtedness.
At June 30, 2024, the principal amount of long-term notes outstanding was $10.0 billion. See Note 14, Borrowings, in the 2023 Form 10-K for more information on overall borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2023.
During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company paid approximately $118 million of interest on long-term notes. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at June 30, 2024 were as follows:

In March 2024, the Company fully repaid $1.0 billion of 3.50% Notes at maturity.
July 2024 Notes. In July 2024, BlackRock Funding issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $800 million of 4.60% notes maturing on July 26, 2027 (the ""2027 Notes""), $500 million of 4.90% notes maturing on January 8, 2035 (the ""2035 Notes"") and $1.2 billion of 5.35% notes maturing on January 8, 2055 (the ""2055 Notes"") (collectively, the ""July 2024 Notes""). Net proceeds are intended to be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Preqin Transaction, which is expected to close before year-end 2024. Interest on the 2027 Notes of approximately $37 million per year is payable semi-annually on January 26 and July 26 of each year, beginning January 26, 2025. Interest on the 2035 Notes and 2055 Notes of approximately $25 million and $64 million per year, respectively, is payable semi-annually on January 8 and July 8 of each year, beginning January 8, 2025. The July 2024 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “July 2024 Notes Guarantee”, collectively, with the March 2024 Notes Guarantee referred to as the ""Notes Guarantees"") on a senior unsecured basis by BlackRock. The July 2024 Notes and the July 2024 Notes Guarantee rank equally in right of payment with all of BlackRock Funding and BlackRock’s other unsubordinated indebtedness, respectively. The July 2024 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of BlackRock Funding at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable series of July 2024 Notes. In addition, if the Preqin Transaction is not consummated, BlackRock Funding will be required to redeem all outstanding 2027 Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a Special Mandatory Redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of 2027 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption date.
Supplemental Guarantor Information
BlackRock Funding is a recently formed, wholly owned direct subsidiary of BlackRock formed in connection with the GIP Transaction, which is expected to close in third quarter of 2024. BlackRock Funding is the issuer of the previously described March 2024 Notes and July 2024 Notes (collectively the ""2024 Notes""), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by BlackRock. The 2024 Notes and the Notes Guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of BlackRock Funding and BlackRock’s other unsubordinated indebtedness, respectively. No other subsidiary of BlackRock or BlackRock Funding guarantees the 2024 Notes. The Notes Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, and BlackRock will be released from all obligations in its capacity as guarantor, in certain circumstances as described in the indentures governing the 2024 Notes. See Note 13, Borrowings and 24, Subsequent Events, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the 2024 Notes.
As permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, BlackRock has excluded summarized financial information for BlackRock Funding in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of BlackRock Funding are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in BlackRock’s condensed consolidated financial statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors.
Commitments and Contingencies
Investment Commitments. At June 30, 2024, the Company had $770 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity funds and real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies as well as recent accounting developments, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information.
Consolidation. The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert absolute control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once its economic interest falls below 10%. As of June 30, 2024, the Company was deemed to be the PB of approximately 110 VIEs, which are BlackRock sponsored investment products. See Note 5, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Fair Value Disclosures, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.
Investment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts (""SMAs""). These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
Performance fees, including carried interest, are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. Such performance fees are recognized when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal. Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgment is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or SMAs have the ability to (a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or (b) distribute their sales proceeds and determine the timing of such distributions.
The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees and other third parties. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 15, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.","Item 1A.

93,2019-01-25,,,,,,,,,,,," Other Events As of , we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs, which amends ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits, to require employers that present a measure of operating income in their statements of operations to include only the service cost component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in operating expenses. The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost should be presented in the same operating expense line items as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, including interest costs, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost/credit and actuarial gains/losses, and settlement and curtailment effects, are to be included separately and outside of any subtotal of operating income. This guidance impacted the presentation of our condensed consolidated statements of operations with no impact on net income. As adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis, we are furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide our historical condensed consolidated statements of operations and selected segment information presented herein. This Current Report on Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings.

On  , Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) issued its press release announcing financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended  . A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors’ overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future. We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to the GAAP presentation. Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release. This information facilitates management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results. Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making. Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company’s expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company. The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Basis of Presentation
The financial information presented in this Form 10-Q is not audited and is not necessarily indicative of our future consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) or cash flows. Our fiscal year-end is October 31, and our fiscal quarters end on January 31, April 30 and July 31. Unless otherwise stated, these dates refer to our fiscal year and fiscal periods.
Executive Summary
Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.
On November 14, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of ACEA Biosciences (“ACEA”), a developer of cell
analysis tools, for approximately $250 million in cash. The financial results of ACEA have been included within our financial results from the date of the close.
Net revenue of $1,284 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 increased 6 percent when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the three months ended January 31, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business for the three months ended January 31, 2019, increased 2 percent when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the three months ended January 31, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business for the three months ended January 31, 2019, increased 13 percent when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the three months ended January 31, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. Revenue generated by Agilent CrossLab in the three months ended January 31, 2019, increased 8 percent when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the three months ended January 31, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 3 percentage points when compared to the same period last year.
Net income for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was $504 million compared to net loss of $320 million for the corresponding period last year. Net income for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was impacted by a discrete benefit of $299 million related to the restructuring and extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.The net income for the three months ended January 31, 2018 was impacted by a discrete tax charge of $533 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the Tax Act""). See Note 5, ""Income Taxes"" for more details. In the three months ended January 31, 2019, cash generated from operations was $213 million compared to $215 million in the same period last year.
For the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, cash dividends of $52 million and $48 million, respectively, were paid on the company's outstanding common stock.
On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2019 repurchase program"") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended January 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares for $75 million under this authorization. As of January 31, 2019, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $1.675 billion of our common stock under this program.
On May 28, 2015, we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 repurchase program authorized the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018. The 2015 repurchase program did not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended January 31, 2018, we repurchased 674,000 shares for $47 million under this authorization. As of January 31, 2018, we retired approximately 637,000 shares of the 674,000 shares purchased in the period and the remaining 37,000 shares purchased were retired in February 2018. On November 1, 2018, the remaining authorization of $188 million under this repurchase program expired.
Looking forward, we continue to focus on differentiating product solutions, improving our customers' experience and growing our earnings. In addition, we remain focused on a balanced capital allocation through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue for the rest of 2019 but we also anticipate the contribution from our recent acquisitions to partially offset the currency impact.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the U.S. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the U.S. requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes. Other than accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes as described below, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements.
Revenue Recognition. On November 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606’’).
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.
We derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under ASC 606. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses sold by us, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria
to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.
Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service (""SaaS""), post contract support (PCS), consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. These contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.
We have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.
Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Stand-alone selling prices (SSP) are determined at contract inception for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.
Certain of our revenue relate to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type capital lease using the current lease classification guidance.
Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. At January 31, 2019, we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain U.S. and U.S state and foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue
to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law. The Tax Act significantly changes the existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. There were no substantial changes from our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K to the transition tax expenses amount. The company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements. Any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined. We have completed our analysis and elected to treat GILTI as “current period cost”. See Note 5, ""Income Taxes"" for more details.
Adoption of New Pronouncements
See Note 2, “New Accounting Pronouncements,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.
Foreign Currency
Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points in the three months ended January 31, 2019. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the condensed consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.
Results from Operations
Net Revenue
Net revenue of $1,284 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 increased 6 percent when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the three months ended January 31, 2019 had a unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year.
Services and other revenue increased 8 percent for the three months ended January 31, 2019 when compared to the same period last year. Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from Agilent CrossLab services and services in the diagnostics and genomics business including consulting services related to the companion diagnostics and nucleic acid
businesses. Some of the prominent services include repair and maintenance on multi-vendor instruments, compliance services and installation services.
For the three months ended January 31, 2019, Agilent CrossLab business service revenue increased 7 percent, with a 3 percentage point unfavorable currency impact when compared to the same period last year. The increase in the Agilent CrossLab and diagnostics and genomics service revenue reflected continuing business growth in nearly the entire portfolio in all regions.
Net Revenue By Segment
Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business for the three months ended January 31, 2019, increased 2 percent when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the three months ended January 31, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. For the three months ended January 31, 2019, revenue growth was led by continued strength in the pharmaceutical market. Revenue growth was also strong in the academia and government and environmental markets partially offset by a decline in growth in the food and chemical and energy markets in the three months ended January 31, 2019.
Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business for the three months ended January 31, 2019, increased 13 percent when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the three months ended January 31, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. For the three months ended January 31, 2019, revenue growth within the diagnostics and clinical market continued to improve across all businesses led by strong performance from our nucleic acid solutions business.
Revenue generated by Agilent CrossLab in the three months ended January 31, 2019, increased 8 percent when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the three months ended January 31, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 3 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. For the three months ended January 31, 2019, revenue grew across all key end markets with strong growth in the academia and government, forensics and environmental and pharmaceutical markets.
Operating Results
Total gross margin for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was relatively flat when compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the three months ended January 31, 2019 reflects higher sales volume and lower share-based compensation expense offset by increased wages, higher expenses related to tariffs and higher amortization expense of intangible assets.
Research and development expenses in the three months ended January 31, 2019 increased 9 percent when compared to the same period last year. Research and development expenses increased due to increased program spending on new products
related to all of our businesses in addition to higher wages and additional expenses related to acquired businesses when compared to spending in the same period last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in the three months ended January 31, 2019 when compared to the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was due to increased wages, higher acquisition and integration costs partially offset by lower share-based compensation expenses and favorable currency impact.
Total operating margin for the three months ended January 31, 2019 increased approximately 1 percentage point when compared to the same period last year. Operating margin for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was impacted by higher sales volume and lower share-based compensation expense partially offset by increased wages, higher acquisition and integration costs, higher expenses related to tariffs and higher amortization expense of intangible assets.
At January 31, 2019, our headcount was approximately 15,300 as compared to approximately 13,800 at January 31, 2018. The increase in headcount is mainly due to the acquisition of several businesses and employees in our service business.
Other income (expense), net
In the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, other income (expense), net, includes $3 million of income in both periods related to the provision of site service costs to, and lease income from Keysight Technologies, Inc. The costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations. Also included in other income (expense), net for the three months ended January 31, 2018 is a $5 million pension settlement gain related to the substitutional portion of the defined benefit pension plans established under the Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law.
Income Taxes
For the three months ended January 31, 2019, the company's income tax benefit was $256 million with an effective tax rate of (103.2) percent. For the three months ended January 31, 2019, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of $299 million related to the restructuring and extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore. The income taxes for the three months ended January 31, 2019 also includes the excess tax benefits of $4 million from stock-based compensation.
We completed a restructuring of our operations in Singapore in December 2018 which extended and modified the company’s tax incentive until 2027. The restructuring along with the application of the new accounting rules under ASU 2016-16, intra-entity transfer of assets on November 1, 2018, resulted in a $299 million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
For the three months ended January 31, 2018, the company's income tax expense was $553 million with an effective tax rate of 237.3 percent. The effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by a discrete charge of $533 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the Tax Act""). The income taxes provision for the three months ended January 31, 2018 also includes the excess tax benefits of $11 million from stock based compensation.
2017 U.S. Tax Reform - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law. The Tax Act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and (2) imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.
The Tax Act also establishes new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”); (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (""FDII""); (6) repealing the domestic production activity deduction; and (7) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation.
GILTI: The Tax Act subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI. The U.S. GAAP allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in the U.S. taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”). We have completed our analysis and elected to treat GILTI as a “current period cost”.
In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2015 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. There were no substantial changes from our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K to the status of the open tax years in the first three months of fiscal year 2019.
It is reasonably possible there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.
Segment Overview
In 2019, we adopted new guidance related to the presentation of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. See Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements"" for more information. As a result, we have recast our historical segment results to conform to this new presentation required under this guidance. Also, in the third quarter of 2018, we re-organized our operating segments and moved the microfluidics business from our life sciences and applied markets operating segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment. Following this re-organization, we continue to have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent Crosslab business. All historical financial segment information for both the life sciences and applied markets segment and the diagnostics and genomics segment has been recast to reflect this reorganization in our financial statements.
Life Sciences and Applied Markets
Our life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (""LC"") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (""LCMS"") systems; gas chromatography (""GC"") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (""GCMS"") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (""ICP-MS"") instruments; atomic absorption (""AA"") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (“MP-AES”) instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (""ICP-OES"") instruments; Raman spectroscopy; cell analysis plate based assays; flow cytometer; real-time cell analyzer; laboratory software for sample tracking; information management and analytics; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies.
Net Revenue
Life sciences and applied markets business revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2019 increased 2 percent when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the three months ended January 31, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. Revenue from our recent acquisition contributed 2 percentage points to our revenue growth in the three months ended January 31, 2019. Geographically, revenue increased 6 percent in the Americas with 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, decreased 5 percent in Europe with a 2 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and increased 4 percent in Asia Pacific with a 2 percentage point unfavorable currency impact for the three months ended January 31, 2019 compared to the same period last year. Strong revenue growth during the three months ended January 31, 2019 in liquid chromatography, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, informatics and cell analysis products was partially offset by weaker sales in liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and gas chromatography when compared to the same period last year.
For the three months ended January 31, 2019, revenue results by end markets were mixed with the pharmaceutical and environmental markets continuing to deliver strong revenue growth while the food and chemical and energy markets delivered
weaker results when compared to the same period last year. Revenue growth in the academia and government markets was also strong driven by performance of our cell analysis products, which includes products from our recent acquisition.
Looking forward, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the life sciences and applied markets as our broad portfolio of products and solutions are well suited to address customer needs. We anticipate strong sales funnels given new product introductions as we continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio. While we anticipate volatility in our markets, we expect continued growth across most end markets.
Operating Results
Gross margin for products and services for the three months ended January 31, 2019, was flat when compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was impacted by higher expenses related to tariffs and logistics costs which was offset by favorable currency impact.
Research and development expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2019, increased 4 percent when compared to the same period last year. The increase in research and development for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was due to additional expenses related to our recent acquisition as well as annual wage and benefit increases partially offset by favorable currency impact.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2019, was flat when compared to the same period last year.

Geographically, revenue increased 23 percent in the Americas with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, increased 4 percent in Europe with a 3 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and increased 11 percent in Asia Pacific with a 2 percentage point unfavorable currency impact for the three months ended January 31, 2019 compared to the same period last year. For the three months ended January 31, 2019, the growth in Americas was driven by strong growth in our nucleic acid solutions and companion diagnostic businesses and continued strength in our pathology and microfluidics businesses. The performance in Europe was driven by growth in our reagent partnership and genomics businesses. In Asia Pacific the growth was driven by our reagent partnership and pathology businesses.
For the three months ended January 31, 2019, the diagnostics and genomics business revenue grew by 13 percent with positive growth in all businesses and regions. The global growth was led by very strong revenue performance in our nucleic acid solutions business. The end markets in diagnostics and clinical research remain strong and growing driven by an aging population and unhealthy lifestyle.
Looking forward, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the diagnostics markets and continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio. We remain positive about our growth in these markets, as our OMNIS products, PD-L1 assays and SureFISH continue to gain strength with our customers in clinical oncology applications and our next generation sequencing target enrichment solutions continue to be adopted. Market demand in the nucleic acid solutions business related to therapeutic oligo programs continues to be strong. We are investing in building further capacity in our nucleic acid solutions business to address the future demand for the oligos. We will continue to invest in research and development and seek to expand our position in developing countries and emerging markets.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our financial position as of January 31, 2019 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2,057 million as compared to $2,247 million as of October 31, 2018.
As of January 31, 2019, $1,562 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries and can be repatriated to the U.S. as local working capital and other regulatory conditions permit. As a result of the Tax Act, our cash and cash equivalents are no longer subjected to U.S. federal tax on repatriation into the U.S. We utilize a variety of funding strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
As a result of the Tax Act, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax of $426 million on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. federal income tax. The transition tax is payable, beginning this fiscal year, over eight years with 8 percent due in each of the first five years, 15 percent in year six, 20 percent in year seven and 25 percent in year eight.
We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash inflow from operating activities was $213 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 compared to cash inflow of $215 million for the same period in 2018. In the three months ended January 31, 2019, we paid approximately $79 million under our variable and incentive pay programs, as compared to a total of $69 million paid during the same period of 2018. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately $21 million and $32 million in the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the three months ended January 31, 2019, the net change in tax-related assets and liabilities related to the enactment of the Tax Act of zero compared to $533 million in the same period in the prior year which primarily consisted of an estimated provision of $480 million of U.S. transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as well as an estimated $53 million associated with the impact of the decreased U.S. corporate income tax rate. For the three months ended January 31, 2019, deferred taxes used cash of $281 million compared to cash used of $6 million in the same period in 2018. The cash used in January 31, 2019 primarily relates to the restructuring of our operations in Singapore of $266 million. For the three months ended January 31, 2019, other assets and liabilities have cash inflow of $26 million compared to cash inflow of $24 million for the same period in 2018. Cash inflow in the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 in other assets and liabilities was related to changes in non-U.S. transaction tax receivables and deferred revenue.
In the three months ended January 31, 2019, accounts receivable used cash of $22 million compared to cash used of $5 million for the same period in 2018. Days’ sales outstanding as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 was 58 days and 56 days, respectively. Accounts payable used cash of $16 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 compared to cash used of $3 million in the same period in 2018. Cash used for inventory was $12 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 compared to cash used of $34 million for the same period in 2018. Inventory days on-hand was 102 days as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.
We contributed approximately $6 million to our defined benefit plans in both the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We expect to contribute approximately $19 million to our defined benefit plans during the remainder of 2019.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $290 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $67 million in the same period of 2018. Investments in property, plant and equipment were $39 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 compared to $60 million in the same period of 2018. We expect that total capital expenditures for the current year will be approximately $175 million. In the three months ended January 31, 2019, we invested $248 million in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, compared to $6 million in acquisitions in the same period last year.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was $122 million compared to cash provided by $37 million for the same period of 2018.
Treasury Stock Repurchases
On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2019 repurchase program"") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended January 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares for $75 million under this authorization. As of January 31, 2019, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $1.675 billion of our common stock under this program.
On May 28, 2015, we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 repurchase program authorized the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018. The 2015 repurchase program did not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended January 31, 2018, we repurchased 674,000 shares for $47 million under this authorization. As of January 31, 2018, we retired approximately 637,000 shares of the 674,000 shares purchased in the period and the remaining 37,000 shares purchased were retired in February 2018. On November 1, 2018, the remaining authorization of $188 million under this repurchase program expired.
Dividends
During the three months ended January 31, 2019, we paid cash dividends of $0.164 per common share or $52 million on the company's common stock. During the three months ended January 31, 2018, we paid cash dividends of $0.149 per common share or $48 million on the company's common stock. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.
Credit Facilities
On September 15, 2014, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for a $400 million five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on September 15, 2019. On June 9, 2015, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion. As of January 31, 2019, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the three months ended January 31, 2019.
Long-term debt
There have been no other changes to the principal, maturity, interest rates and interest payment terms of the Agilent outstanding senior notes in the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to the senior notes as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.
Other
As of January 31, 2019, our contractual obligations reported under “other purchase commitments” were approximately $90 million, an increase of approximately $10 million from fiscal year 2018, primarily due to the new contracts that were executed during the period. There were no other substantial changes from our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K to our contractual commitments in the first three months of fiscal 2019. We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. We have no other material non-cancelable guarantees or commitments.
Other long-term liabilities as of January 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018 include $608 million and $607 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities. Of these amounts, $216 million and $215 million related to uncertain tax positions of continuing operations as of January 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.","ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results
Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.
Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.
If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.
We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•
properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;
•
innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;
•
appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;
•
successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;
•
manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;
•
differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;
•
price our products competitively;
•
anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and
•
control product quality in our manufacturing process.
In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or providing drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures.
General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
Our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:
•
reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;
•
increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;
•
increased price pressure for our products and services; and
•
greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.
Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.
Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.
Demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.
Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.
Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately 2 percentage points in the three months ended January 31, 2019. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
•
interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;
•
changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;
•
changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;
•
tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs enacted and proposed by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain;
•
negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export;
•
difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;
•
differing labor regulations;
•
differing protection of intellectual property;
•
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and
•
geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war.
We sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from various countries. Tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, additional tariffs which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.
In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.
Our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.
We have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future. These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.
Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.
Our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.
In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.
Integrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks. Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business models, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodologies and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
Even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transaction.
A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.
Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
Our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and workers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.
We must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.
These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.
Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.
We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
A number of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.
Some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.
Our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.
We derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.
Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.
We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.
Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.
We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
The impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.
The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.
If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.
Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.
Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results.
Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (""IT"") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price.
Environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.
Certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination. Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if
these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled. In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed, or provided indemnities for, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters. Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.
Our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve, or have involved, the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions. If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.
Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.
Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.
Our pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.
We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.
Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.
The 2017 United States Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) significantly changed the taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations. Our compliance with the Tax Act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. The implementation of the Tax Act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities. The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.
We are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.
If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.
We benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.
We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
We currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion in senior unsecured notes. We also are party to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in September 2019. On June 9, 2015, we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion. As of January 31, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.
Our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:
•
increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;
•
requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and
•
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing
our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.
If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.
If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.
We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.
Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.
As of January 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.1 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.
Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.
We are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.
We could incur significant liabilities if the distribution of Keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.
We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of Keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, we received, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.
We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.
Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.",1284.0,,A,16:08:06,True,True,"[        nan         nan         nan         nan         nan         nan

96,2019-03-13,76.5490493774414,,,,,,,,,,1284.0," Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement On , Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Credit Agreement among the Company, the lenders party thereto and BNP Paribas, as Administrative Agent (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $1,000,000,000 five-year, unsecured credit facility (the “Facility”) that will mature on . The Facility replaced the Company’s existing credit facility, which was terminated on the closing date of the Facility. The Company may, subject to obtaining commitments from existing or additional lenders and satisfaction of certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the Facility or create new incremental term loan facilities in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate (each, an “Incremental Facility”) and may extend the maturity date for a period of one year. Each lender will have discretion to determine whether it will participate in an Incremental Facility or in any such extension of the maturity date. The Company will use amounts borrowed under the Facility for general corporate purposes, including stock repurchases and potential acquisitions. The Company is not borrowing under the Facility at this time, but may borrow under the Facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Company’s option, either at: (i) the alternate base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate in effect from time to time, (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect from time to time plus 1/2 of 1.00% or (c) the applicable London interbank offered rate for 30-day loans plus 1.00%, in each case plus the applicable margin for such loans, or (ii) the applicable London or EURO interbank offered rate plus the applicable margin for such loans. The applicable margin for loans bearing interest at the alternate base rate ranges between 0.000% and 0.425%, and the applicable margin for loans bearing interest based on the London or EURO interbank offered rate ranges between 0.920% and 1.425%, in each case based on the Company’s senior debt credit ratings as published by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings Inc. At the Company’s current credit ratings, the applicable margin for alternate base rate loans is 0.025%, and the applicable margin for London or EURO interbank offered rate loans is 1.025%. The Company is required to pay to each lender, based on such lender’s commitment, a quarterly facility fee during the term of the Credit Agreement which varies depending on the Company’s credit ratings. At the Company’s current credit ratings, the facility fee will be 0.100% per year, or $1,000,000 per year. The Company is also required to pay letter of credit participation fees ranging from 0.920% to 1.425% per annum (based on the Company’s credit ratings) and a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum, in each case based on the average daily amount of outstanding letters of credit. At the Company’s current credit ratings, the letter of credit participation fees will be 1.025% per year. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of liens, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness by the Company’s subsidiaries and limitations on sale-leaseback transactions. These covenants are subject to a number of significant exceptions and limitations. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company’s ratio of adjusted consolidated financial indebtedness to consolidated capitalization not be greater than 0.65 to 1.00 as of the end of any of its fiscal quarters. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Lenders may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. In addition, if the Company or certain of its material subsidiaries becomes the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable. BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citibank, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners for the Credit Agreement. The description of the Credit Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Some of the lenders under the Credit Facility and/or their respective affiliates have from time to time performed and may in the future perform various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services for the Company and/or its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, for which they received or will receive customary fees and commissions.

On November 1, 2018, the remaining authorization of $188 million under this repurchase program expired.
Looking forward, despite challenging market conditions, we continue to focus on differentiating product solutions, improving our customers' experience and growing our earnings. In addition, we remain focused on a balanced capital allocation through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue for the rest of 2019 but we also anticipate the contribution from our several acquisitions in the past year to partially offset the currency impact.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the U.S. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the U.S. requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes. Other than accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes as described below, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements.
Revenue Recognition. On November 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (""ASC 606"").
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.
We derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under ASC 606. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses sold by us, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.
Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. These contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.
We have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.
Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Stand-alone selling prices are determined at contract inception for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.
Certain of our revenue relate to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type capital lease using the current lease classification guidance.
Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. At April 30, 2019, we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain U.S. and U.S state and foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law. The Tax Act significantly changes the existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. There were no substantial changes from our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K to the transition tax expenses amount. The company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements. Any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined. We have completed our analysis and elected to treat global intangible low-tax income (""GILTI"") as “current period cost”. See Note 5, ""Income Taxes"" for more details.
Adoption of New Pronouncements
See Note 2, “New Accounting Pronouncements,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.
Foreign Currency
Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 3 percentage points in the six months ended April 30, 2019. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the condensed consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.

Operating Results
Total gross margin for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 increased 1 percentage point and was relatively flat, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. Gross margin for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 reflects the impact of lower inventory charges, lower materials costs and favorable currency impact on costs offset by increased wages, higher expenses related to tariffs and higher amortization expense of intangible assets.
Research and development expenses in the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 increased 8 percent in both periods when compared to the same periods last year. Research and development expenses increased due to increased program spending on new products related to all of our businesses in addition to higher wages and additional expenses related to acquired businesses when compared to spending in the same period last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4 percent and 3 percent in the three and six months ended April 30, 2019, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended April 30, 2019 was due to increased wages, higher share-based compensation expense and higher acquisition and integration costs partially offset by operational efficiencies and savings and favorable currency impact. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended April 30, 2019 was due to increased wages and higher acquisition and integration costs partially offset by operational efficiencies and savings and favorable currency impact.
Total operating margin for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 was relatively flat in both periods when compared to the same periods last year. Operating margin for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 was impacted by increased wages, higher acquisition and integration costs, higher expenses related to tariffs and higher amortization expense of intangible assets offset by lower spending and planned operational savings and favorable currency impact.
At April 30, 2019, our headcount was approximately 15,550 as compared to approximately 14,000 at April 30, 2018. The increase in headcount is mainly due to the acquisition of several businesses and employees in our service business.
Other income (expense), net
In the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, other income (expense), net, includes $3 million and $6 million, respectively, of income in both periods related to the provision of site service costs to, and lease income from Keysight Technologies, Inc. The costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations. Also included in other income (expense), net for the six months ended April 30, 2018 is approximately $15 million of income related to a special one-time settlement with a third-party and a $5 million pension settlement gain related to the substitutional portion of the defined benefit pension plans established under the Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law.
Income Taxes
For the three and six months ended April 30, 2019, the company's income tax expense was $36 million with an effective tax rate of 16.5 percent and an income tax benefit of $220 million with an effective tax rate of (47.2) percent, respectively. For the six months ended April 30, 2019, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of $299 million related to the restructuring and extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore. The income tax provision for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 also includes the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $3 million and $7 million, respectively.
For the three and six months ended April 30, 2018, the company's income tax expense was $22 million with an effective tax rate of 9.7 percent and $575 million with an effective tax rate of 125.0 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by a discrete charge of $533 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act. The income taxes provision for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018 also included the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $7 million and $18 million, respectively.
2017 U.S. Tax Reform - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law. The Tax Act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and (2) imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.
The Tax Act also establishes new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”); (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (""FDII""); (6) repealing the domestic production activity deduction; and (7) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation.
GILTI: The Tax Act subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI. U.S. GAAP allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in the U.S. taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”). We have completed our analysis and elected to treat GILTI as a “current period cost”.
In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2015 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. There were no substantial changes from our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K to the status of the open tax years in the first six months of fiscal year 2019.
It is reasonably possible there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits. The company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements. Any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined.
Segment Overview
In 2019, we adopted new guidance related to the presentation of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. See Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements"" for more information. As a result, we have recast our historical segment results
to conform to this new presentation required under this guidance. Also, in the third quarter of 2018, we re-organized our operating segments and moved the microfluidics business from our life sciences and applied markets operating segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment. Following this re-organization, we continue to have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business. All historical financial segment information for both the life sciences and applied markets segment and the diagnostics and genomics segment has been recast to reflect this reorganization in our financial statements.

Foreign currency movements for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points in both periods when compared to the same periods last year. Revenue from our recent acquisitions in the past year contributed 2 percentage points to our revenue growth in the three months ended April 30, 2019. Geographically, revenue increased 1 percent in the Americas with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, decreased 3 percent in Europe with a 5 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and decreased 2 percent in Asia Pacific with a 2 percentage point unfavorable currency impact for the three months ended April 30, 2019 compared to the same period last year. The revenue decline during the three months ended April 30, 2019 was driven by a decrease in sales of LC and LCMS products partially offset by strong performance in our cell analysis products and atomic absorption products. Revenue increased 4 percent in the Americas with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, decreased 5 percent in Europe with a 4 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and increased 1 percent in Asia Pacific with a 2 percentage point unfavorable currency impact for the six months ended April 30, 2019 compared to the same period last year. Flat revenue growth during the six months ended April 30, 2019 was driven by weakness in sales in our LC, LCMS and spectroscopy businesses which was offset by strength in informatics and cell analysis products when compared to the same period last year.
For the three months ended April 30, 2019, revenue results by end markets were mixed with the academia and government and forensics markets delivering strong revenue growth while the food market and to a lesser extent the pharmaceutical and chemical and energy markets delivered weaker results when compared to the same period last year. Revenue growth in the academia and government markets was also strong due to performance of our cell analysis products, which includes products from our recent acquisitions. For the six months ended April 30, 2019, revenue results by end markets were mixed with the academia and government and forensics markets delivering strong revenue growth, pharmaceutical and environmental markets delivering moderate growth while the food and chemical and energy markets delivered weaker results when compared to the same period last year.
Looking forward, despite short term uncertainties, we are optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities in the life sciences and applied markets as our broad portfolio of products and solutions are well suited to address customer needs. We
anticipate strong sales funnels given new product introductions as we continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio. While we anticipate volatility in our markets, we expect continued growth across most end markets.

Operating Results
Gross margin for products and services for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019, was flat for both periods when compared to the same periods last year. Gross margin in the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 was impacted as gains from higher volumes were mainly offset by an unfavorable product mix.
Research and development expenses for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019, increased 20 percent and 23 percent, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. The increase in research and development for the three months ended April 30, 2019 was due to additional expenses related to prior year's acquisitions, higher wages and benefits and increased spending around the development of clinical applications and solutions.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019, was flat for both periods when compared to the same periods last year. Selling general and administrative expenses in both periods, was impacted by a favorable currency impact, operational efficiencies and savings in field selling costs offset by incremental expenses related to our prior year's acquisitions.
Operating margin for product and services for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 decreased 1 percentage point and increased 1 percentage point, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. The decrease in operating margin for the three months ended April 30, 2019 was mainly due to higher research and development investments related to prior year’s acquisitions. The increase in operating margin for the six months ended April 30, 2019 was mainly due to higher revenue volumes, more than offsetting the research and development investments related to prior year’s acquisitions.
Income from Operations
Income from operations for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 increased $1 million and $10 million, respectively, on a corresponding revenue increase of $11 million and $39 million, respectively, due to higher revenue volumes.

Net Revenue
Agilent CrossLab business revenue for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 increased 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. Foreign currency movements for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. Revenue from our recent acquisitions in the past year contributed 2 percentage points to our revenue growth for both the three and six months ended April 30, 2019, when compared to the same periods last year. Geographically, revenue increased 8 percent in the Americas with a 2 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, increased 3 percent in Europe with a 7 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and increased 9 percent in Asia Pacific with a 5 percentage point unfavorable currency impact for the three months ended April 30, 2019 compared to the same period last year. Recent acquisitions contributed 3 percentage points in the Americas and 1 percentage point in Europe for the three months ended April 30, 2019. Revenue increased 8 percent in the Americas with a 2 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, increased 5 percent in Europe with a 6 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and increased 9 percent in Asia Pacific with a 4 percentage point unfavorable currency impact for the six months ended April 30, 2019 compared to the same period last year. Recent acquisitions contributed 3 percentage points in the Americas and 1 percentage point in Europe for the six months ended April 30, 2019. During the three and six months ended April 30, 2019, revenue growth was driven broadly by our entire service and supplies portfolio.
For the three months ended April 30, 2019, the Agilent CrossLab business saw broad-based revenue growth in all key end markets, but the growth was especially strong in the food, academia and government, chemical and energy markets when excluding the impact of recent acquisitions. For the six months ended April 30, 2019, the Agilent CrossLab business saw robust revenue growth across all key end markets.
Looking forward, we anticipate strength in all key end markets will continue to drive our revenue growth in the near term. The Agilent CrossLab portfolio of products and services are well positioned to succeed in changing market conditions in any of our key end markets. Geographically, the business is well diversified across all regions to swiftly take advantage of regional market opportunities and to help hedge against volatility in any one region. Other factors for near term revenue growth include our continuing expansion of our e-commerce sales channel.
Operating Results
Gross margin for products and services for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 increased 1 percentage point for both periods when compared to the same periods last year primarily due to favorable currency impact on costs. In addition, the gross margin was positively impacted by improvements to the operational efficiency of the service delivery business.
Research and development expenses for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 was relatively flat when compared to the same periods last year. The slight increase was primarily due to higher wages and additional research and development expenses from recent acquisitions.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 increased 2 percent for both periods, when compared to the same periods last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended April 30, 2019 was primarily due to additional operating expenses from recent acquisitions, higher wages and higher share-based compensation expense, partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency movements. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended April 30, 2019 was primarily due to additional operating expenses from recent acquisitions and higher wages, partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency movements.
Operating margin for product and services for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 increased approximately 3 percentage points for both periods when compared to the same periods last year. The improvement in the operating margin for both of those periods were driven by strong growth in revenues and gross margins, combined with only a modest growth in operating expenses.
Income from Operations
Income from operations for the three and six months ended April 30, 2019 increased $19 million and $37 million, respectively, on a corresponding revenue increase of $29 million and $63 million, respectively.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our financial position as of April 30, 2019 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2,155 million as compared to $2,247 million as of October 31, 2018.
As of April 30, 2019, $1,686 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries and can be repatriated to the U.S. as local working capital and other regulatory conditions permit. As a result of the Tax Act, in general our cash and cash equivalents are no longer subjected to U.S. federal tax when repatriated into the U.S. We utilize a variety of funding strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
As a result of the Tax Act, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax of $426 million on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. federal income tax. The first installment of $36 million was paid in the second quarter of 2019 and the remaining will be paid over the next seven years.
We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash inflow from operating activities was $465 million for the six months ended April 30, 2019 compared to cash inflow of $518 million for the same period in 2018. In the six months ended April 30, 2019, we paid approximately $79 million under our variable and incentive pay programs, as compared to a total of $69 million paid during the same period of 2018. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately $104 million and $48 million in the six months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the six months ended April 30, 2019, the net change in tax-related assets and liabilities related to the enactment of the Tax Act of zero compared to $533 million in the same period in the prior year which primarily consisted of an estimated provision of $480 million of U.S. transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as well as an estimated $53 million associated with the impact of the decreased U.S. corporate income tax rate. For the six months ended April 30, 2019, deferred taxes used cash of $272 million compared to cash used of $13 million in the same period in 2018. The change of cash in the six months ended April 30, 2019 primarily related to the restructuring of our operations in Singapore of $266 million. For the six months ended April 30, 2019, other assets and liabilities had cash outflow of $46 million compared to cash inflow of $26 million for the same period in 2018. Cash outflow in the six months ended April 30, 2019 was largely the result of increased income tax payments, interest payments on senior notes and changes in deferred revenue. Cash inflow for the six months ended April 30, 2018 in other assets and liabilities were related to changes in the transaction taxes and deferred revenue.
In the six months ended April 30, 2019, accounts receivable used cash of $17 million compared to cash used of $21 million for the same period in 2018. Days’ sales outstanding as of April 30, 2019 and 2018 was 59 days and 56 days, respectively. Accounts payable used cash of $8 million for the six months ended April 30, 2019 compared to cash used of $14 million in the same period
in 2018. Cash used for inventory was $21 million for the six months ended April 30, 2019 compared to cash used of $34 million for the same period in 2018. Inventory days on-hand was 104 days as of April 30, 2019 compared to 95 days as of April 30, 2018.
We contributed approximately $11 million to our defined benefit plans in both the six months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We expect to contribute approximately $15 million to our defined benefit plans during the remainder of 2019.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $346 million for the six months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $118 million in the same period of 2018. Investments in property, plant and equipment were $78 million for the six months ended April 30, 2019 compared to $108 million in the same period of 2018. We expect that total capital expenditures for the current year will be approximately $170 million. Cash used to purchase fair value investments for the six months ended April 30, 2019 was $18 million compared to $1 million in the same period in 2018. In the six months ended April 30, 2019, we invested $248 million in our acquisition of ACEA, net of cash acquired, compared to $7 million in acquisitions in the same period last year.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended April 30, 2019 was $214 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $77 million for the same period of 2018.
Treasury Stock Repurchases
On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved the 2019 repurchase program designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. During the six months ended April 30, 2019, we repurchased 1.766 million shares for $125 million, under this authorization. During the six months ended April 30, 2019, we retired approximately 1.757 million shares for $124 million. The remaining 9,000 treasury shares were retired on May 1, 2019. As of April 30, 2019, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $1.625 billion of our common stock under this program. In the third quarter of 2019, we anticipate repurchasing more shares than our typical quarterly repurchases.
On May 28, 2015, we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 repurchase program authorized the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018. The 2015 repurchase program did not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time. During the six months ended April 30, 2018, we repurchased and retired 1.3 million shares for $93 million under this authorization. On November 1, 2018, the remaining authorization of $188 million under this repurchase program expired.
Dividends
During the six months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, we paid cash dividends of $0.328 per common share or $104 million and $0.298 per common share or $96 million, respectively, on the company's common stock.
On May 22, 2019, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.164 per share of common stock or approximately $53 million which will be paid on July 24, 2019 to all shareholders of record at close of business on July 2, 2019. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.
Credit Facilities
On March 13, 2019, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for a $1 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024. The credit facility replaces the existing credit facility which was terminated the closing date of the new facility. As of April 30, 2019, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for all the credit facilities during the six months ended April 30, 2019.
Long-term debt
There have been no other changes to the principal, maturity, interest rates and interest payment terms of the Agilent outstanding senior notes in the six months ended April 30, 2019 as compared to the senior notes as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.
Other
There were no substantial changes from our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K to our contractual commitments in the first six months of fiscal 2019. We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. We have no other material non-cancelable guarantees or commitments.
Other long-term liabilities as of April 30, 2019 and October 31, 2018 include $579 million and $607 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities. Of these amounts, $221 million and $215 million related to uncertain tax positions of continuing operations as of April 30, 2019 and October 31, 2018, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.","ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results
Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.
Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.
If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.
We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•
properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;
•
innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;
•
appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;
•
successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;
•
manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;
•
differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;
•
price our products competitively;
•
anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and
•
control product quality in our manufacturing process.
In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures.
General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
Our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:
•
reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;
•
increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;
•
increased price pressure for our products and services; and
•
greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.
Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.
Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.
Demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.
Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.
Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately 3 percentage points in the six months ended April 30, 2019. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
•
interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;
•
changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;
•
changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;
•
tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs enacted and proposed by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods
•
negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export;
•
difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;
•
differing labor regulations;
•
differing protection of intellectual property;
•
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and
•
geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war.
We sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from various countries. Tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, additional tariffs, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain, which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.
In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.
Our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.
We have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future. These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.
Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.
Our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.
In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.
Integrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks. Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
Even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.
A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.
Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
Our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and workers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.
We must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.
These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.
Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.
We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
A number of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.
Some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by the EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.
Our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.
We derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.
Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.
We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.
Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.
We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
The impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.
The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.
If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.
Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.
Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results.
Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (""IT"") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price.
Environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.
Certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination. Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if
these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled. In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed, or provided indemnities for, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters. Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.
Our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve, or have involved, the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. Further, in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions. If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.
Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.
Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.
Our pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.
We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.
Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.
The Tax Act significantly changed the taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations. Our compliance with the Tax Act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. The implementation of the Tax Act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), as well as state tax authorities. The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.
We are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.
If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.
We benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.
We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
On March 13, 2019, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for a $1 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024. The credit facility replaces the existing credit facility which was terminated on the closing date of the new facility. As of April 30, 2019, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. We also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion in senior unsecured notes. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.
Our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:
•
increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;
•
requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and
•
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
Our credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur
certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.
If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.
If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.
We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.
Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.
As of April 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.2 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.
Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.
We are subject to the rules of the SEC which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.
We could incur significant liabilities if the distribution of Keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.
We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of Keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, we received, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.
We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.
Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.",1238.0,,A,16:08:36,True,True,"[        nan         nan         nan         nan         nan         nan
